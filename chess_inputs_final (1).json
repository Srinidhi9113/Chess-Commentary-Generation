and the former world champion vladimir kramnik well kramnik has retired from chess but decides to come back for the world blitz 2019 and the london system on the board kramnik a great great positional exponent plays right in the center takes on d4 ed4 and brings his queen to beat six attacking the b2 pawn bishop to f5 look at the speed with which vladimir is playing he has now put a pressure on the c2 pawn and knight b4 is a big big threat magnus can play c3 here and stop that move but he takes his time and he plays bishop e2 oh my god now knight b4 is a big move e6 kramnik misses it he could have played knight before and then there was no way to defend c too well you know in that position carlson would have been in big trouble but now he just castles and all is well all is back to normal pushes respond to a4 trying to gain more space on the queen side if this pawn is not stopped it can go a5 a6 kramnik thinking here what to do because if he pushes his own pawn to a5 it weakens the b5 square and that's the reason why he doesn't want to be pushing his a5 pawn he pushes it only to a6 magnus goes one step forward and the queen comes back to d8 the knight jumps to e5 carlson wants to exchange of those knights rook to c8 and c3 finally black castles and now his king is safe if you look at these this position black is doing pretty well there is no problems his all his pieces are playing well his bishop on f5 is active and now he plonks his knight on e4 on an active square bishop to d3 now carlson is looking at some very strict little moves like f3 in the position kramnik adjusts himself in the chair he knows that now is the time to think carefully he takes on e5 and bishop takes e5 instantly played by magnus bishop to g6 so that now the bishop is firmly supported by two of his pawns until now black has played well he has also managed his clock very well if you look at the times both players have two minutes 20 seconds on the clock carlson plays bishop f4 just moving his bishop one step back and could be that f3 is coming up now knight to d6 and this is the moment where magnus begins to show his class it seems he takes on g6 doubles the pawns and now this is just entirely based on his feel magnus carlsen is thinking whether he should take on d6 or not usually a bishop is a superior piece than a knight but in this very case carlson realizes that his knight would be better than the bishop he puts his pawn on g3 his idea is to play h4 king g2 h5 and begin playing on the king side but meanwhile kramnik realizes these this danger and plays b5 he wants to start playing on the queen side the b3 knight is somewhat under pressure and also the b2 pawn that's why magnus played rookie 2 and supported the b2 pawn now rook to b8 the knight comes back it's a beautiful route for the knight to go from d3 to e5 kramnik plays his queen to b5 h4 magnus is looking at king g2 and h5 at the right moment rook fca and look at this rook d2 opening the queen's path to h5 so that h5 h4 h5 pawn push can be made kramnik now goes rk8 he wants to push his a pawn but before that magnus's queen has already entered on kramnik's king's side g6 has been played and now the queen magnus thinks for a bit where should he move the queen he moves it to 8-6 king g2 and rook h1 on the cards vladimir assesses whether he should deal with that threat no a4 is played now threatening rook h1 bishop comes back moving the queen out and queen comes back to f4 you can see how magnus is 30 seconds ahead on time now but kramnik has managed his time very well he still has one minute 27 seconds and the position is still quite complicated although the black king is slightly under pressure with the queen on f4 knight jumping to e5 and the rook coming to h1 black has his own counter play against the b2 pawn and a4 a3 threatened but who is going to come up ahead in this position bishop to g7 and carlson plays his knight to e5 threatening the f7 pawn if you take the knight then after queenify the dark squares are tremendously weak so that's the reason why you cannot pick up that knight you have to defend your pawn on f7 and vladimir comes back to e8 defends the f7 pawn this is the moment where carlson has to think what to do next he has things going his way but he needs one more piece into the attack how should he be bringing that in also the queen e8 prepares f6 to push the knight so that the g6 pawn is defended rook to d3 he gives up the pressure on the b2 pawn and he is bringing his knight rook to f3 the knight comes to g4 attacking the f6 pawn queen f8 and now rook to f3 he's putting more pressure on f6 magnus carlsen is turning on the screws from absolutely nowhere he's created a scintillating attack against the black king a3 is pushed because if knight takes f6 then the queens get exchanged so would carlson go for that or will he take on a3 first he takes on a3 and now f5 is played attacking the knight but instead of moving the knight he moves the queen now the knight cannot be taken as the queen is hanging on f8 that's the reason why now kramnik moves his king away wow and rook joins in abandoning the queen side take all the pawns you want i am going after your king says magnus carlsen here kramnik down to 30 seconds he has to figure a way out he takes on a3 and carlson now moves his rook to h7 four pieces in the attack two rooks knight and a queen this seems like absolutely crushing attack well how do you defend that knight e5 is threatened knight h6 has threatened so many threats in the position kramnik takes the pawn on c3 but not with great confidence knight at 6 and g6 is taken now the g7 bishop was hanging and kramnik resigns the game what a game that was"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an

board e6 will magnus allow the nimzo indian yes he does he goes knight to c3 and anand instantly pins the knight bishop b4 knight to f3 and invitation to transpose into ragozen and vishi takes it he plays d5 and we are now in ragozan territory cd edie magnus takes a bit of time and puts his bishop on g5 this is the main line theory a question is asked to the bishop would you like to take on f6 or go back to h4 both are viable in the position magnus goes back to h4 and anand castles here magnus plays e3 wanting to develop his bishop to d3 standard way in which you play and vishy goes bishop f5 the main move here is queen to b3 but magnus here plays the relatively unknown knight d2 this is not theory and therefore you see vishy settling down in his chair trying to look in the distance to recollect his theory and he plays the most ambitious move g5 bishop g3 and c5 as you can see knight d2 was not developing a piece moved the same piece in the opening twice and vishi has struck in the center now a3 played a very good move here would have been bishop a5 but vishy takes on c3 b takes c3 and c4 that's his plan white is not going to get e4 easily and he has fixed the c3 weakness but magnus says hiv she your king is weak now i'm going to open it he puts his pawn on h4 and now anand has to decide whether he wants to keep the h-file open he decides to keep it closed with g4 bishop e2 would have been a good move here but instead h5 played is this a bit too slow is white too undeveloped here magnus playing two ambitiously here knight bd7 which he completes his development bishop f4 attacking the h6 pawn now the most natural move here would be king h7 to defend it but instead anan goes for the counter-attacking move queen a5 queen c1 played defending the pawn will wish he now defend that six pawn not really he's not interested he's now threatening to go to a4 and put more pressure on c3 magnus says i'm taking your pawn why not let's just take the pawn on h6 knight a4 walked again vishy does not care about his rook on f8 also he's going after the c3 pawn he says that in this position my main advantage is my bishop on f5 knight on a4 queen on a5 magnus takes the rook and now anand has to decide should he take it with his king or the rook he takes with his rook so that the king can at some point hide on the x7 square what an interesting position f3 by magnus not only trying for e4 at some point but also making a square for his king on f2 which he has to decide how to continue he can actually take the pawn here knight takes c3 or even start off with b5 black has excellent compensation here in fact black might even be slightly better but anand plays rook e8 which is not the best move in the position because it allows magnus to tuck his king away safely to f2 rook 8 is an active move but not in the spirit of the position that was not the move b5 played by vishy and here it seems like he's missed a tactical shot of magnus look at that magnus knows that he has something and he plays e4 now the queen on c1 is breathing it can look at the g5 square it sees that it has an opportunity to go there d takes e4 played here and now the best move is knight takes e4 but instead magnus goes for knight takes c4 it's too tempting to bring your queen to g5 wishes queen is attacked he has to take on c4 and now the queen jumps in to g5 here anand clearly understands he has a choice between king h7 and king f8 you can see he's trying to take his time king f8 is the right move because after queen takes f6 the f7 pawn is protected but instead he goes king h7 and this is going to haunt vishy now because queen takes f6 happens and the problem is in the other position if your king was here you could have gone rookie 6 and made your king safe on e7 but now you can't do it f7 is hanging so vishy plays the intermediate move e3 the pawn is not as dangerous although it can go to e2 at some point magnus takes his time goes to g1 king to g1 and now anand had to waste a tempo to defend bishop e6 but vishy feels that he has counter play by taking on c3 so d5 played by magnus this is kind of a slightly nervous move he wants to defend the c3 pawn if bishop defy he has queen f5 check in the position so vishy is actually thinking with what to take this pawn bishop takes or queen takes he finally decides to take with the queen but the downside to this is that now his c3 pawn is defended here by the white queen so rookie one played by magnus queen d2 wishy not leaving the c3 pawn there rook e2 played if you take on c3 now then queen takes c3 knight takes c3 rookie three and white should be better so vishi keeps queen on c1 magnus brings his queen back he's attacking the e3 pawn now look at how white pieces are are boxed in on h1 and g1 and f1 annan plays gtx f3 trying to open up the g file for his rook and a very good move by magnus queen takes e3 excellently spotted vishi takes on c3 now with his queen and g takes f3 is what magnus wants to do this is still quite a complicated position but now the king has a nice square on f2 so magnus is now in exchange up although there are very few pawns left on the board this should be winning for white king f2 keeping his king safe vishi has four minutes so does magnus queen to g7 the idea is to threaten a mate in one with queen g3 check here on e4 if king gets it then queen e5 exchanges the queens so he goes king h6 in the position and now queen f4 check king at seven and the queen comes to e5 excellent move now there's no queen g3 check the queen is defending that square queen to h6 played by vishy and you can see magnus knows he's very close to the win he calculates it in his head rook g1 offering a rook trade of course all the exchanges are going to favor white here because he's ahead in material so vishy keeps the rook on the board but this turns into a tactical mistake can you spot it how magnus can win queen e4 check first king h8 look at how magnus frees up his rook on the e file king h7 and in comes the blow rook takes e6 if queen takes e6 there is queen g7 mate if fe 6 queen d7 loses the rope magnus wins vichy resigns what a complicated game the expression on the face says it all they now analyze a few lines it was an extremely complicated game really bold play by both the players but in the end it was magnus who came out on top you"},

1-0", "output": "one of the biggest talents in the world of chess nothing abdusatharo from uzbekistan takes on the world champion magnus carlson magnus is currently leading the tournament solely with seven and a half out of nine he had just beaten duda in the ninth round this is a new day and if magnus wins he would most likely go home with the title abdusatharov is of course much lower rated than magnus but look at his focus he's out there for the kill and the game begins off we go with c4 on the board it's the english opening and you will always see magnus taking his time before making his move his first move he wants to feel comfortable he wants to feel focused and totally into the game knight to f6 played here nother bet gets his knight out and now magnus puts his pawn on e5 knight to f3 and knight c6 we have the four knights on the board and nothing plays his favorite line with e4 notice that bishop c5 is a mistake because of knight e5 that's the reason why magnus goes for bishop b4 and now d3 played in the position d6 by magnus bolstering the center the bishop is asked the question it goes back to c5 and b4 pushing the bishop away bishop b6 and nothing back wants that bishop at all costs he goes knight a4 magnus sees there's a hole on d4 so he pins the knight on f3 after the bishop is taken bishop b2 to get some control on d4 bishop takes f3 carlson has given up both his bishops so it's actually going to be two knights versus two bishop and two bishops and look at this maneuver he goes knight d7 he wants to put his knight from f8 to e6 to d4 first a queen trade offered to nothing back and nothing back declines it he goes back to d1 magnus goes knight to f8 it's all about this d4 square weakness are the knights stronger or are the bishops the knight comes out to e6 and nothing back castles now because now he has an idea of playing f4 when his rook would be activated and also his bishop but look at magnus's move he has nipped f4 in the bud with g5 what a move bishop h3 and magnus goes for h5 is he going for an all-out attack well nothing back exchanges one of the knights there and now queen takes e6 b5 pushing the knight away you can't come to b4 because the bishop will snap it off magnus now thinking where to move his knight he goes knight b8 he's undeveloping it but the knight is coming to d7 f4 there you go nothing back opens up the position but whose king is going to be weaker is it magnus's king on e8 or northerbeck's king on g1 knight d7 played you can see from the body language that norther beck really believes in this position he puts his king on the side on h1 magnus knows he has to play carefully queen g4 offering a trade of queens once again will not their back take it he goes queen f3 and now magnus could have exchanged the queen's ear and continued later on with king e7 or so on but he plays f6 which is actually a good move but now abdu-satarov is like maybe i don't need to exchange the queens anymore and he goes queen e3 he keeps the queens on the board magnus has to decide what to do about his king and he decides to long castle the king would be safe there because for white to go a4 a5 will take time nothing back first closes the center with f5 and h4 on the board so rook g8 may come in then h3 there's no time to attack so nadir beck plays on the king side and queen h5 is played here and in goes the rook to g6 that is an advanced outpost on an open file now the knight cannot move because the f6 pawn would be hanging so magnus has to decide how to continue here he challenges the rook with bringing his rook d to g8 the position is right now better for black the reason is that the knife seems to do more in this position than the bishop and also the rook is offered for a trade northern beck now brings his other rook and puts pressure on g8 so magnus must take the rook on g6 also on time magnus has five minutes nothing back has four minutes 40 seconds and after thinking for quite some time he takes with the pawn which is the may be the correct decision here and now carlson says i want that pawn but nothing pushes it to the seventh rank queen at seven played maybe not the best move queen h3 excellent move by nothing back because now after the rook trade yes he's lost his g pawn but in return he's got the h pawn so the position is now equal knight to c5 played by magnus he goes to c1 you can't take on d3 because of queen h3 check so b c6 played carlson is still very hopeful that his position is better that his knight is stronger than the bishop but white also has his trump card here and his big trump card is his h-pawn the h-pawn is a passer right now it's a little guy on h2 but as it keeps moving it will become an important factor in the game queen f3 queen at seven played by magnus look at how nothing back has managed his time he has two minutes as compared to carlson's 40 seconds but guys there is a 10 second increment per move so the world champion isn't much worried that he goes king a6 with 26 seconds only on his clock now the rebec brings his king in he's hoping that at some point he can start pushing his edge pawn the position still remains completely equal queen g7 now maybe time to move your king to f2 get it towards the center he goes to f1 now queen at seven played h3 by abdusattar or the first step of the h pawn is taken but there are six more steps to go five more steps d5 played by magnus look at him he's playing for win here queen f5 now taking the queen here would not be a great idea because then after queen f5 ef5 the h-pawn is a passer so magnus now gets really focused because there's also a queen c8 check threatening somewhere he goes queen g8 keeps the queen on the board takes on d5 cd you can see that magnus is slightly worried but he is so ambitious he wants to win this game draw is not enough from the tournament situation a draw is actually pretty good for carlson but he wants to dominate king to b5 and now bishop e3 played here nothing back has managed to keep the position roundabout even here queen g2 check bishop comes back and how does magnus make progress here oh he's trying to move his king down the board king a4 and nothing effects says take the a pawn if you like i'm pushing my h pawn down the board so that is definitely a cause of worry e4 played here now takes he takes with the knight there's no real threat in the position and actually nothing back can now play queen f3 and exchange the queens he plays it he plays it and magnus should take it perhaps though he goes queen g6 knight and queen coordinate pretty well but h5 the pawn moves one step closer now queen eight and you can see that nothing back is shaking his head he's not too happy here because guys there is a trick in the position there is a discovered check on the e5 and if bishop e3 is played here to block it then magnus can take the pawn on h5 look at this variation if bishop e3 i can take queen h5 queen h5 knight g3 with a fork so bishop e3 does played and nothing back knows that now he cannot win this position magnus sees oh and he goes f5 he doesn't want to go into that droid line he wants to still fight for a win h6 nothing big spawn now moving to h6 just two steps away from queening queen to e5 by magnus king f1 playing it calmly here although black species are coordinating much better the edge pawn is worth its weight in gold here now threatening knight d2 check magnus is so tricky but not the back of course tactical monster he goes king g2 he sees all these tricks and now queen g8 check and the king comes to h3 well keeping the knight on the board is important but magnus now goes for knight g5 check a very surprising decision because after queen takes g5 it seems not very likely that he can win but magnus thinks he can win this h6 pawn he wins the a pawn now this is the moment where nothing back can make a draw because there there's a perpetual there the king is moving to if oh he goes to a5 check here and i think magnus is fine with the draw now because there are a lot of checks here in the position and there's no way to get out of it but nothing back says no draw i have an advanced pawn and there you can see magnus settling down in this chair he knows this is not going to be a quick draw because now the tables have turned it's still a draw the position is still drawn but with the h pawn white's chances of winning are much higher because in queens queen end games it's not important how many pawns you have always also the quality of the pawn matters a lot right now the pawn has reached the seventh rank and with just eight seconds on clock magnus goes queen to e5 this is a mistake he should have gone queen g1 but in queen endgame it's very difficult to take advantage of these errors quindy one check is the correct move but he goes king g4 and we are again in droish territory and now magnus pushes his pawn to f3 well if you take it then well there's no real threat he actually takes it and magnus has no check which wins the pawn because the pawn is defended so he's just given up the pawn and there you can see with just six seconds left on the clock it's a very difficult end game and not back playing with so much confidence check on h4 and he moves in with his king even further down carlson definitely has something to worry here he is hesitating he gives a check on h5 but the king can now go to the corner on a8 objectively it's still drawn practically this is very difficult magnus thinking from where to give a check also the time on the clock is not helping him he has just three seconds he gives a check on g6 not airbag meanwhile maintaining a healthy lead with 40 seconds on his clock he goes king to c7 and another check on g3 king b7 where do you check from next i think f3 looks like a normal check magnus plays queen f3 he's managed to play this carefully but how many accurate moves can you make with just a few seconds on the clock queen f6 maybe the answer is magnus can make many after all he's the world champion queen f2 check king b7 northern back trying his hardest here for the full point he now blocks with the queen if you take the queen of course you lose because the h pawn queen so a check here threatening that seven pawn so the only move now is to put queen to c7 check on f3 this time king a6 and he can go queen f6 check here once again but maybe he didn't like queen b6 and then the b5 pawn falls with no check in the position so magnus here once again decides to give a check from a8 which is fine but after king b6 he has no checks so he goes to h8 and blocks the pawn but this gives nothing back a free hand to now start his checks how does he do it well maybe the first check has to come from c2 also carlson has built up enough time with the last few checks he has now 35 seconds and the position still is drawn check on c2 now king a3 seems like the right move white does not want to take the b5 pawn because that pawn if taken black can start checking him so here nadir beck is careful with what he wants to do now he has 30 seconds and so he goes queen d3 check the right move here is king a4 going back but then you lose the b5 pawn with the check which is fine but magnus decides to go king a he's confused come back go forward he goes king a2 and this is actually not the best move this can give nothing back some chances to win queen g6 might be the best move here in this position table bases say it's made in 70 but of course there is a 50 more rule there first king c5 and now a check on c8 or a check on f8 would have been good but magnus now with just 20 seconds on the clock takes a pawn in his hand he's thinking how exactly should he continue and he decides should he give up the b pawn oh man he's going to give up his b pawn which is going to be a big blunder it's going to be the losing mistake and he plays it he plays b4 but little does he know that this is actually losing queen d2 and now king a3 important he blunders with king a1 misses quindy for check and magnus understands that he's blundered here because after the queen trade the h pawn goes forward here's another angle with so many people watching and magnus has lost the game nothing back has taken the lead magnus being a very gentleman here arranging all his pieces but he has lost the lead and a 16 year old phenom from uzbekistan has beaten the world champion what a big result you"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

Qxf7+ 1-0", "output": "world number one Blitz player Hikaru Nakamura takes on something with Gujarati and we are off Nakamura starts off with the flexible English E5 D3 this has been nakamura's strategy in this tournament to just play openings which give him fresh positions not to worry about Theory Knight to C6 and now what does Naka do is he going to expand with B4 takes a small think and yes he does gaining space on the queen side with it using the central strategy playing in the center this is a reverse Sicilian now that we are witnessing on the board Knight F3 the idea is to push with B5 and win the pawn on E5 so black has to be slightly careful here how to continue one idea is to play F6 to bolster the pawn the other one is to put the bishop on D6 and you can see that nakamura's opening strategy has somehow worked out because he has made with it to think with it does go Bishop D6 and although the position is around equal Hikaru gets some time Edge really quite important in Blitz E4 hitting the Knight forcing it to move back the Knight can go to many places it can go to B6 E7 it goes to E7 black has a flexible position while white is definitely angling for the D4 break at the right time A6 played just so that B5 is not possible Knight to D2 the Knight is coming to C4 Castles by with it it feels like shwashnikov but with white knight to C4 and very quickly played Knight G6 Hikaru just adjusts his Knight there and plays G3 very interesting he stops the knight from coming to F4 and also plans to develop the bishop on G2 now with it does have some need and development and so he goes B5 and that's the Hikaru to take the bishop on D6 well Nakamura declines goes 93 A5 quickly played ba and now Rook A5 with the pressure on A3 Pawn would be a good idea Queen E7 also possible later on and a lot of pressure there but with the ticks with the Knight not a bad idea he also would want to go C5 Knight C6 Knight D4 and that's also a viable plan in such a position vidit has played this opening pretty well and has at least got equality with black Hikaru goes Bishop to G2 and now C5 now the D3 Pawn is a permanently backward Pawn you cannot push but Hikaru instead of castling goes H4 and this is modern Chess at its best your king is in the center but you don't care now with it creates a square for his Knight there but Hikaru pushes it Knight of it pushes at six G6 So within three moves the pawn has moved from H2 to H6 and now White Castles notice that this Pawn can be both a strength and a weakness but modern chess has understood that 86 more often than not becomes a strength than weakness this is very important to understand Alpha 0 has played many such games which has improved the human understanding of pushing the edge Pawn but for now with it says I don't understand this so well I'm going to just play centrally the D4 square is weak my pieces are well positioned I can develop my Bishop on B7 Knight can come back to C6 to D4 so I don't see why this is such a big problem he goes Rook f8 just keeping an eye on the F6 point for black also it's very difficult to make progress with F5 or something because the bishop on B2 is very strong and now look at this subtle move the Rook is looking at B5 and in future can become a weakness there Knight C6 with it just bringing all his pieces to good squares Knight comes back so he carries idea with Knight H2 did not really work out with Knight G4 he comes back to F3 and with it now can he jump to D4 but then maybe B5 would hang later so he goes King h8 ooh slightly dangerous yes he comes out of all these checks but he is in the line of this bishop Bishop H3 Bishop pops out here keeps an eye on the Knight Rook B8 a good move by with it defending the B5 Pawn yes he gave up the control of the A5 a file but uh be defending B5 is important talking catch to both players down to nearly a minute on the clock Rook F7 and you can see how they are just making little moves not disturbing the balance in the position black is slightly better now F5 could be an idea but you don't want to disturb status queue here and with it goes Knight to C7 offering a trade of Bishops and also trying to evict the strong Knight on D5 what does Hikaru do now does he exchange yes he takes on C8 Queen C8 and goes Queen to B3 notice how this queen is angling at The Rook on F7 a very good idea now is to take on D5 and maybe after Queen D5 just move the Rook away or just move the queen and the position is round about even but look at with it he's burning time here and this is the critical moment of the game because although the position is even with it has lost a lot of time oh he's got attracted by this tactical shot here where after dcbc the queen will be attacked and if the queen takes the pawn The Rook will be hanging whoa what a nice tactic but look at this variation DC BC yes takaburra takes it he takes the challenge he takes Here and Now with it can pick up the Rook for free but there is Knight C3 hitting the rook and F7 no Nakamura doesn't see it he does not play Knight C3 he plays Queen takes C6 and now with it is better clearly he's doing well but now he can take take and take on F6 it seems or first Knight D2 the F6 Pawn is soft but Hikaru goes back Queen C2 Rook comes back to B8 with it is better Knight must be chopped off on D5 is he going to do that yes he does black is an exchange up yes white has compensation and don't forget this Pawn on H6 Queen G4 interesting move that was a very nice move in fact Queen C7 was the best move for black but Queen G4 played King G2 by Hikaru bishop f8 and now A4 with it has to press but look at his time 15 seconds no he planned us big time and his back rank is weak now you can see the Rook the queen joining in the bishop coming out and the pawn on it six create a mating net like no other and with this Hikaru is clearly better with just one move giving up the last rank everything is now in White's control how does Hikaru finish this off well it's not so simple but he just needs to play Bishop A3 he does it Queen takes E4 and finds Queen C8 another powerful move Now The Rook is hanging if the Rook boost the bishop is hanging and with it out of nowhere has landed up in a very difficult position takes on B4 Queen takes B4 and how do you finish it off because for now it looks defended he goes Queen C6 to take control of this diagonal G4 Knight comes out to H4 and queen B7 was important you know F5 is bad Knight G6 is winning 86 Queen G6 but Hikaru misses it plays Queen D5 with the true fight Queen B7 no he plays this and Nakamura simply chops it off and with no time on the clock Nakamura is winning he had just the pawn he's threatening Knight D6 and he plays it his Rook The Rook is now pinned Queen takes F7 and Hikaru wins with it was doing very well in the position but Hikaru was very quick to spot all the tactics and he's discussing with with it what he did wrong foreign"},

hitting the center nihal pauses for a bit takes the pawn on C4 Knight A3 I like how the Knight is attacking C4 Bishop G7 gukesh takes the pawn Knight comes out Bishop G2 and nihal instantly plays E5 the pawn is defended by his Knight and Bishop gukesh thinking about what his next move should be Place D3 to stop E4 but nihal goes E4 anyway regardless of it Queen takes King takes by the way this is something that bhukesh has already played once before I think it was against manual petrocion and nihal has come well prepared he goes Knight F6 attacks the pawn and asks do you want to push your Pawn because if you do I'll go Knight G4 hitting F2 and E5 this is how Mukesh had played last time and so gukesh taking his time and this time he goes Knight cd2 that is his improvement over his game against his past opponent and that's why you can see nihal sarin also pausing a bit trying to figure out what's the best way but it's a beautiful Pawn Sacrifice by nihal to close this bishop also to keep the king in the center and you will notice how nihal builds up now so first thing that he can do is he can castle and get his Rook to d8 that's exactly what he does he castles and white king is not feeling comfortable Knight E1 looks like a passive move but Mukesh wants to go to D3 then pushes Pawn to F4 and E5 so he's trying to solidify himself also D3 is an important Square for the Knight because it controls B4 and the Black Knight cannot reach on B4 so these are some of the concepts in the position now nihal how does he continue one idea is to play Rook d8 just get on the open file and the other one is to look at Knight G4 there is also a possibility of playing Bishop E6 not to forget that you can expand on the queen side with A5 so as to meet Knight D3 with Knight B4 nihal goes Rook d8 very logical chess he improves his rope puts it Opposite the king and tells gukesh that your king is not safe but in doing so look at his time he's down to one minute 50 seconds while bouquet still has a solid 40 second lead on the clock how does Mukesh continue here a good idea can be Knight C2 also possible Knight D3 but you know it is always this a little bit of an irritating Moon Knight G4 or even the bishop can come out to G4 I think in order to stop it plays H3 but it's not the best move here it's slow but one can understand that he wanted to prevent Knight G4 business now thinking about what his next move should be plays a beautiful move A5 this move is a multi-purpose move as we said night before is prepared also A4 A3 would gain more space weaken this diagonal this Pawn sacrifice is something to learn from guys because you can see how nihal in spite of being pawned down has nothing to worry because of the various compensating factors that he has a safer King much better placed pieces free-flowing pawn moves and so on gukesh meanwhile trying to figure out what is the way in which he can create maximum trouble for nihal sarim well he can put his Knight on D3 that is possible but then nihal will go night before exchanging and opening his a file but Mukesh says nothing doing I'm going all out I'll play E5 but nihal says Knight H5 I'm attacking your Pawn on G3 and it's very difficult to defend it because if you go G4 F4 is hanging has bhukesh just blundered the pawn very difficult to say from mukesh's expression because he does not emote much he plays Bishop F3 maybe that was his plan you don't know you can play A4 or even Knight D4 but who can resist such a juicy Pawn on G3 nihal cannot he chops it off Rook G1 has to come back to H5 but now gukesh takes it spoils nihal structure but in doing so nihal has recovered his Pawn he's still doing pretty well here F5 I like this move King f8 because F6 was threatened mihal comes out with his King if Mukesh can manage Knight D3 which he does then Knight F3 then bring out his Bishop he should be doing fine but that takes some time meanwhile nihal can go B6 and Bishop A6 oh he does it he does it he finds it what brilliant play by Michal this has been out of the opening he has played this really well and vukesh is down to 53 seconds nihal has one minute 21 seconds how does white continue now okay one plan is Knight F3 now just bring your knight to F3 plays it Knight to F3 on the board Bishop A6 played and now BG5 excellent move just hassling The Rook here F6 doesn't look right because then the bishop gets closed you want to maybe move the Rook but that doesn't look great knight D4 is an option to sacrifice and exchange here hmm But what does nihal do he's also does not have too much time here and I think gukesh has been successful in complicating the position completely focused you can see there he's trying to make a decision one thing that he mustn't do is play rookie six oh and he does it well the reason is Bishop F4 Rook D7 and now Rook C1 or even E5 white is in the driver's seat all of a sudden because yes Bishop D3 Pawn D3 Rook D3 is hanging but then just King E2 comes in and white is doing completely fine oh he goes E5 that's a nice move and all of a sudden it's gukesh who has a decisive Edge in the position after nihal has made some really inappropriate moves now F6 is a major threat and nihal has to deal with it you never want to play a pawn to F6 but then sometimes it is a necessity and nihal is not making that move happily that is for sure gukesh has to just push his Pawn he does so Rook D5 attacking the pawn on F5 Rook C1 played Knight is hanging Bishop B5 and now Knight H4 defending the pawn should be a good idea here and white has a very very pleasant position is so low on time he has 10 seconds left he goes Bishop D2 that is not a good idea because he has sort of blundered this Pawn Rook takes F5 maybe he did not notice it maybe he has some other plans in mind no he takes oh that was his plan Knight D4 with a double attack on the rook and the bishop but now Bishop E4 is possible to defend the Rook no he goes Bishop A4 check B3 Rook D5 now the Knight is hanging Bishop C3 C5 is winning for black but nihal has also just 15 seconds left what does he do C5 Bishop E8 both look great his Bishop is hanging he saved he if he saves it he's an exchanger saves it Knight F4 and now Rook D6 that should be winning but rookie five blunder that's a big mistake because now E7 is coming in and he finds it what a move E7 if rookie seven there's Knight D6 so he goes King F7 and now cookies with four seconds plays Knight D6 The Rook is hanging Rook take C6 has to be played but he plays here in Bishop at six again a mistake The Rook is taken has only three seconds left he has to make a move oh he lose this sort of time in a position that is completely winning gukesh loses on time nihal is shocked he cannot believe it Mukesh is shocked he just cannot believe that in a better position he is he has lost on time because King takes E6 is met with Knight C7 check and you can see how these two guys are friends of each other and really like to play good chess because in spite of the win nihal is not happy and Mukesh of course is completely shocked that he lost on time foreign"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an

Rook takes C5 Rook take C5 Bishop E4 trying to stop the pawn he's materially doing pretty well nihal with two pieces for a rook but one of his pieces is going to bite the dust here because the B Pawn is too strong B7 he gives up the bishop Rook takes B7 and Arjun still with more time than what he began with its Moon number 38. wow I think rarely would we see a game between two very strong Grand Masters where one of them finishes the game with more time than what he began with well now Arjun is taking some time but that's because he just wants to make sure he can technically convert this position properly Rook D4 played now the pawn is hanging Knight B2 and Rook B4 if A3 then there is Rook check and root A8 so he goes Knight D3 but now Arjun takes the pawn G5 nihal hoping for a fortress there but uh it is not possible three pawns are a bit too much and Rook is clearly superior to the Knight Arjun making sure that he will convert this and uh now you will see that Arjun takes his time to figure out where to put his pieces King F2 Knight to F4 played Rook D4 Knight goes back Rook to C4 F5 G3 played no King F6 so nihal hoping for some kind of a fortress here but Arjun is very patient he's not going King E3 which allows F4 King E5 first to check pushing the king back King F6 and now Arjun pins the Knight Rook B6 King to E5 and after some thought he goes G4 notice how Arjun has kept a queen in his hand he thinks that he'll very soon make a queen and now the white king comes up after you know sort of fixing the queen kingside pawns the white king is ready to March up the board F takes G4 H takes G4 King E5 a waiting move there the Knight cannot move because the 8-6 pawn is hanging the King has to go back that allows the white king to move even further black king goes back and now arjun's King is ready to enter and I think that is game over nihal resigns brilliant prep by Arjun nihal and Arjun are good friends and they would generally talk after the game but today Arjun has just outplayed his opponent completely and even though nihal won the tournament this final game would not be a very pleasant memory for him but what unbelievable amount of prep by Arjun it turned out that Arjun had this preparation yeah 32 moves of prep right and the question is did he had he prepared it for nehal or did he prepared for someone I mean the first problem for nihal is I think both of them Arjun and nehal have seem to prepare the French together that's my guess I'm not Aspen but that's my guess which means that against the one that you want to play the friend you can't play because he he knows your thing I don't know that could be a factor this line has got that little danger that um Knight D4 Bishop G6 Bishop F4 Rook C8 what he did and um it seemed round about equal like it was not I have a feeling but I check my notes because there's always some detail that you don't remember C4 and then Bishop C7 King f8 um so the really amazing thing is on move 27c for rookie for C5 and nihal just seemed shocked even that that was possible so against uh C5 Knight D3 Arjun gave the variation Rook C4 Knight B2 Rook C3 uh Knight D1 Rook C1 um is it Rook D4 uh uh C6 B Tech C6 B6 Rook takes D6 B7 Rook d8 F3 quite more because the most important thing is takeaway is four so the obvious question is well then if my root comes Bishop comes in a different route Bishop S5 and then it's Rook C5 not Rook C6 because then I go Bishop E6 Rook A6 Bishop D5 controlling A8 but Rook C5 so you don't have the same idea and black I mean just to recap black is two full pieces up he has a postpone on A4 versus whites on B7 but he's totally helpless he is not even getting to give up the room because he gave up the rookie still when he has two pieces and two pounds but he's not able to even give up The Rook against the spawn and white doesn't even have an open file yet he still has to capture on C6 or go to A5 but uh uh great uh prep anyway he showed a lot of beautiful lines um yeah amazing and I think he prepared it for shark and it helped with nihal ah he prepared for okay that I think so yeah so I checked this line yesterday actually it was shock but it didn't happen yesterday and it happened today so you have to tell us till where was your preparation because we were just amazed at your clock man all the way yeah until the Rook C1 we were so impressed with it apparently it was all prepped yeah until this point oh my God chat now it makes sense the clock situation oh I I don't hear phone most of the only mutes and this is like the final test if he finds this so check and hear backpack B6 93 B7 the B1 here we saw this B8 take Tech and events F2 I win the F4 Pawn but he has an extra point so it should be there but instead he played this um actually 860 only move in that position okay you basically have to create a lift for the thing exactly okay and then you give the look for the B Pawn and I take the F2 Pawn the Bishops would be in the game but it doesn't change because the main thing is he would have three points and I would have two points right origin everyone's gone crazy after you said this was preparation really how how did you get so many moves was there some game until some point um I don't know I don't keep track of other people so you're just analyzing all the possibilities in a position and I think I should thank question for this yeah he was the one who worked on this a bit okay and yeah I did not check but Bishop C5 was the only liturgical more because did you know that Bishop C5 is a mistake foreign [Music] actually I was looking at the bishop f8 position item here so without giving a check Arjun you are left-handed right yeah you can do it right now I can only do with that Mouse you can only do it right wow oh nice super nice"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

and in the rapid event it was Wesley who had triumphed over Hikaru so this is something where Nakamura will be vying for his revenge also in shorter formats Hikaru is considered to be a quite a strong player and you can see there Wesley taking out his hotel card as well as his ring he's getting ready for the struggle and off we go Knight F3 by Hikaru C5 played by Wesley and E3 this is some sideline stuff by Nakamura to just throw Wesley off his preparation Wesley taking his time to figure out which way he wants to place his pieces because you can put your Bishop on G6 you can also put it on E6 which way you want to continue okay so D5 and now Hikaru goes C4 now all of a sudden we are in some kind of Karo Khan territory perhaps if he takes with the pawn nobody takes with the Knight now this is not a great idea because black can now kick the Knight away with E5 there's also one more example of how Hikaru is a very practical Blitz player even though he knows that black will equalize quite easily with E5 what he wants is a more original position more than anything else E5 played by Wesley Knight goes back and now the Knight comes out to C6 so black has an excellent position he has space more Development Center control everything flowing for him now Knight takes D5 Queen takes D5 both moves make a lot of sense Wesley takes with the queen offering a queen trade should you take it or not is the question here and Hikaru is grappling with it he could go Knight C3 but then black will take on D1 the other option is to take on D5 but then Knight takes D5 and maybe the Knight comes to B4 and then to C2 these are some of the possibilities here so Hikaru taking his time two minutes 14 seconds and he goes Bishop D2 so he avoids the queen trade obviously can just go Bishop B7 this is this is one way to continue also or he can hit with E4 but E4 Knight C3 has to be checked so for example let's say you go E4 Knight C3 Queen F5 I think this is a very interesting position things can get sharp with Knight B5 he takes F3 Knight C7 check king d8 and you really don't want to be calculating these things with a discovered check coming up here and stuff like that but this is better for black Wesley decides to keep it simple and goes Knight E4 but after Knight C3 takes Bishop C3 you can see that white has now an equal position out of the opening so black small Edge is now gone F6 are very strong Center for black Bishop C4 played Bishop B4 you can see how Wesley so quickly exchanging the pieces with black is okay with solid equality out of the opening times are also even Hikaru with his famous Expressions there he's not happy with how the opening has transpired A3 the Knight comes back because check King E2 there was nothing much happening after Knight C2 check so he comes back Rook C1 played King E7 now the idea is to play Bishop E6 so he goes bd5 now you can't play Bishop E6 because C6 will be taken but I think Wesley can just defend it with Bishop D7 that seems fine he goes Bishop D7 and now should Hikaru Castle in such positions you generally want your king to be in the center he plays B4 first and not so sure about this muru cap C8 nice move he places other Roku can't see it because he wants to hit the queen side with A5 which he does now if I've played and this is becoming tricky for Hikaru because after B5 Knight d8 A4 now notice this A4 Pawn is a weakness it's an important pawn and if you go Bishop G4 that is a very interesting move but he goes Bishop E6 maybe not the best he could have played Bishop G4 and chopped this Knight off because in the end game this A4 Pawn could become a huge weakness but he went Bishop E6 which is very natural humanly to play Hikaru takes do you take with the Knight yes he does and Knight D2 now can you put your knight on C5 attacking the pawn on A4 while meanwhile Hikaru wants to go Knight C4 or Knight B3 to attack A5 yes he plays Rook C4 defending the A4 Pawn how do you attack it for the Knight D7 excellent move by Wesley so he wants to come to B6 hit the rook and also the pawn amazing look at C1 by Hikaru doubling the Rooks also attacking the C8 Rook Knight B6 is met with Rook Tech C8 Rook Tech C8 and then another Rook trade and the Knight maybe could come to B3 or C4 so he takes first on C4 and Hikaru takes with the Rook you want to play Knight B6 but then there is Rook C7 check you don't want that to happen so Wesley plays King to d8 very logical which Pawn is weaker A4 or A5 the battle is just about these few pawns here Rook G4 wow The Rook is swinging on the fourth rank but what is The Rook going to do after G5 black not only saves this Pawn but also gains Pace Wesley plays it and now his threat is to play H5 kick this Rook away from the fourth round then go Knight B6 and win this pawn and once you win the A4 Pawn your Rook is behind the a pawn and this Pawn will start to roll so is this big trouble for Hikaru here is there a problem you can see time wise Hikaru is going down he's not able to find that sequence of moves that gives him counter Play and play that he's looking for he goes Knight B3 he plays his Knight to B3 now should we go H5 or should we first go Knight B6 one thing that Knight B3 has done is that it has top knight C5 so now the Rook can be safe on the E4 square if needed he goes H5 Rook to E4 here and now notice if you play F5 which is quite interesting then The Rook will come to C4 he plays Knight to B6 first G4 by Hikaru now H4 is very much possible but then it closes down the position also cements The Rook on e4 because F5 no longer is possible Wesley now can get ambitious H4 is a very solid move could lead to equality but he goes King E7 his point is if you take here he wants to go Rook catch it and take this what is Hikaru going to play not rukichit maybe he goes H4 wow what a move here Nakamura all of a sudden he's put the board on fire all the pawns looking at each other now the best move is to take King E6 but he takes here which is a blunder because now all of a sudden it's hikaru's Rook which is active it's going to stop the pawn and his Edge Pawn is very strong Knight to C5 attacking p7 things simply turned completely there within a span of couple of moves Hikaru plays H6 he knows that he is in control King G8 Rook takes actually first winning one Pawn now should he bring his King in because the black pieces are completely tied up King F3 Knight to D5 the king comes in even further Knight to C3 check King F5 B6 Knight D7 and he takes on F6 and Wesley resigns within just few seconds the game turned around but that is Blitz chess let's have a look at that critical moment of the when Hikaru played his Pawn up to G4 Wesley had an option to push push his Pawn to H4 but he went King E7 and his point was that if you take here then yes you can't go to catch it because then your A5 Pawn hangs B7 hangs but he would come up with King E6 first and then look for ideas like King F5 F5 to trap the rook and it can get really nasty here the best way to continue is say Rook G4 F5 Rook G5 Knight A4 and the position remains very complex but instead of doing GTX H5 here what he carved did was he just threw the board on fire with H4 this is a very typical move just confusing everything the best move now was King E6 and it's so difficult to play a move like this the point is that if you play GTX H5 F5 Rook is trapped and game is over because the King has now defended the E6 Pawn the best move is to take here with the pawn 1 and then after King D5 hitting the Rook F3 H takes G4 Rook takes G4 fg5 the position is slightly better for white he can't take on G5 yet because A4 is hanging but he can play something like King D3 and the game goes on and in this way sort of equality could have been maintained but under lot of pressure and less time vastly blundered with GTX H4 and this was a bad move because after takes H3 Rook H4 white spawn is way stronger and black spawn is falling Hikaru went on to win the game foreign"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

there he is not there back Abdul satara of the reigning rapid Champion is there and Magnus is talking to his good friend Daniel dubo he likes to talk to him before his games we can also see with it there in the background and Magnus going to his board the top board clash between the current classical champion and the current world rapid Champion when you look at another bag you see a boy still a boy he's 18 years old filled with confidence is not intimidated by the world champion 15 minutes plus 10 second increment off we go Magnus begins with one B3 wow this is the opening that he has been playing in this tournament slightly off beat presses the clock Knight comes out to C6 foreign defending his E5 Pawn E3 played uh this is how generally you develop and nothing but taking his time because B3 is slightly offbeat opening although nowadays people are coming prepared for it was as well Knight to F3 now one more attack on the pawn generally black pushes the pawn and white goes Knight D4 but not their back places Bishop to D6 now this is slightly awkward because it Blocks Your d-pawn but later what you do is you Castle put your Rook on it pull your Bishop back and then play D6 or D5 so short Castle played and Magnus now continues with a D3 improves its position Rook E8 and another small little move A3 the idea is to somehow expand on the queen side with B4 and black nips that idea in the bud with A5 stopping the B4 expansion Magnus continues with his development Bishop E2 and as discussed the bishop drops back to f8 Preparing the central brake D5 now White Castles I think another back is going to play yes he does D5 cd5 played by Magnus and now Knight takes D5 guys we are in a reverse Sicilian situation generally the position that white has is what black takes and it's known as the Hedgehog setup Knight comes out to D2 you will see that white is limited to the first three ranks F6 played while black has more space but white can break through at the right time Queen C2 on the board now let's just take a minute here and wind back the clock by 52 years Yes you heard it right 1970s this position was exactly played in the game between Fisher with white and Anderson with black Anderson played Bishop to E6 and guess what Fisher did here the reason I'm showing you this game is because Magnus was highly inspired by this game against when he played against not their back the move that was played was not the normal Rook C1 or Rook D1 or rookie one or Knight E4 or Knight C4 these are all normal standard moves but Fisher came up with a completely new plan King H1 and his idea is to put his Rook on G1 and play G4 G5 this is how the game continued Rook G1 Rook d8 Knight came up and now G4 and just he brought his Rook up he brought his other rook in brought his Knight to C5 other Knight came into F5 and before you knew it white had a huge attack so once you have the background of this idea as to that in such a position you can go King H1 Rook G1 G4 let's go back to to our game well what does Northern back do is he going to continue like Anderson with Bishop E6 no he goes Bishop F5 and notice you can't play E4 because Knight F4 attacks the bishop on E2 so for now Bishop F5 does stop E4 and now Bishop G6 played you can see Magnus thinks for a bit and goes for G4 in the footsteps of Bobby Fischer he thinks that look I don't need to play King at you on Rook G1 with the idea of G4 I can get it directly now nodir back attacks the pawn here do you play H3 not really Magnus goes King H1 and he's telling another back if you come and take this Pawn I'll take here and give a discovered attack to your queen which is not a good thing for black so for now Magnus has got this move G4 without even playing Rook G1 is that a small Improvement well perhaps for now Magnus brings out his Knight to E4 we we noticed in the game of Fisher versus Anderson that white built up a huge attack by bringing his Rook to G1 G3 and the other Rook to G1 will Magnus continue that way what is not their back's plan for now Magnus is keeping his cards open but it's kind of funny that he's already played G4 and he's not going ahead with the Rook G1 plan Bishop F7 played by not their back and now Magnus brings his Rook to G1 Knight B6 look at this these pieces are now angling at the queen side Magnus goes Rook G3 well trademark Fisher stuff but now Northern back is not playing like Anderson he goes A4 and he chips away at the queen side one very important variation is that D4 is met with Bishop B3 so that's the reason why Magnus takes the pawn but now Knight A5 this is hanging Bishop is threatening here so all of a sudden even before Magnus can get King side play Northern back has created a lot of inroads on the queen side now not a good move Bishop D5 the best move was to take this Pawn but not their back places Bishop to D5 which is not the best idea now Magnus can actually push a spawn on G5 and that's what he does Magnus realizes oh F5 that he can actually attack and now look at this variation you can go Knight F6 sacrifice your knight take take and open up your Rook that would have been amazing but instead Magnus goes Knight C3 back which is also okay not but not the best Bishop C6 and he plays his Pawn up to E4 picks up the pawn on A4 and he's telling Magnus that look if I get rid of your Bishop on B2 that would be not good news for you because that's some important Bishop so Magnus takes the Knight and now another back must recapture he takes it and now Queen C3 attacks the Knight on A5 of course you can't give up that night so the Knight has to reroute itself but it's such a mess you have a backward Pawn here you have a weak Square here who's better well Magnus says who cares about weaknesses I'm going at your king he goes G6 94 attacking the bishop on E2 what does Magnus do now does he save his Bishop Bishop F1 but then black goes at six well the best moves that she finally finds it wow what a move and the point here is that after Knight takes into he wants to sacrifice a piece knight F7 check Queen F7 there was a better move there Knight C3 instead of Knight F7 Queen C4 was better but now Magnus is making a queen on the board who's winning it's so chaotic Bishop takes E8 well Rook takes E8 was much better there but Bishop takes E8 now Bishop C3 and Bishop came out to G6 we'll analyze this position a bit more in depth after the game but all of a sudden what we have reached here is a position where white is an exchange up but black has a pawn for it but now he takes the pawn and G7 is under pressure you must go Ruby seven and defend it it's very important here to defend that pawn but instead he takes on D3 that's a huge blunder but Magnus has to find this Rook takes G7 move use Rook takes G7 Bishop takes G7 Bishop takes G7 check King G8 Bishop F6 discovered check and you win The Rook that's the plan and you can see Magnus has seen the winning idea he takes his Rook chops on G7 another back is lost the game is over the Uzbek Grand Master generally who's very very confident at this point you can see him he knows that the writing is on the wall he has lost this game it's not even easy to find a move here nor their back looks at Magnus he knows that he's lost this game shakes his head he's a little gestures from which you can understand that it's all over shakes his hand Magnus Carlsen gets the win he has his revenge he's beaten another back he lost to him in 2021 but now what a sweet revenge this was thank you foreign foreign rapid one in Blitz the northern back game where you went G4 uh I'm sure you know the game of Fisher did it pass your head at some point Fisher Anderson when you did this actually I was reading a book by John Donaldson about Bobby Fischer uh just in the days leading up to this tournament so that was uh that was a massive inspiration yeah um I was thinking during the game that I had the feeling that the position was like very very similar uh his Bishop went to F5 G6 I know that Anderson put the bishop on E6 but before that I was like wow this is almost exactly the same uh but then yeah when he puts his Bishop on G6 at first I was thinking ha now I get G4 without even going uh Rook G1 but then I started to to see like these night before sacrifices are extremely dangerous uh I was thinking like the books this book and other books sort of made it seem like Fisher was much better after so listen I didn't see that at all um also in the game you know you know Skirmish random things happen but it was but it was a fun game G6 Knight G5 was amazing I was just uh I'm disappointed that I didn't see Queen C4 rookie 7 GH this is what I missed I didn't I thought about rookie7 but I somehow the moved GH escaped my mind this is disappointing because in the other line uh when I went go Knight F7 it was King G8 uh quincy queen E6 or rookie six then gh7 is the key move so I saw the theme just not in the in that line so fortunately I know I won afterwards but if if I hadn't won the game I would have uh um I would have yeah that would have been so otherwise it would have been an even better game life is full of

Daniel is not to be seen where is he Anish like a true gentleman doesn't start the clock he's like waiting for his opponent to come almost close to a minute passes by it seems and there you have Daniel arriving starts the clock so that we can get going Knight F3 by Anish and as we know Anish giri has amazing bit of preparation he is also very good at opening Theory and positionally very strong so he goes Knight F3 and us dubo can you attack me in this solid opening dubo adjusts all his pieces things for a bit already he's taken close to 30 seconds what is he going to play and well he can go D5 he can also go C5 but he decides to go on D5 ah he goes D5 and Anish goes G3 territory G6 by dubov Bishop G2 Bishop G7 you like the way in which both these players are making their moves very very calmly C4 C6 one of the most solid openings out there it's called the solid grunfeld when you play C6 Anish takes on D5 duboff takes back and the Knight comes out to C3 black castles and white goes Knight E5 but Dupo is well prepared he goes Knight E4 and this seems to be his preparation Anish thinks for a bit takes on e4 Pawn takes E4 and now takes with the bishop on e4 Dupo sacrifices a pawn and now he's ready to give up another Pawn you can see this is attacked twice and something must be done because D4 is attacked he takes on C6 B Tech C6 and now the bishop comes out on E3 the idea of dubo was that if you take on C6 he wants to just go Rook B8 and claim compensation but now Bishop H3 the white king cannot castle that's the very important Point here rupee it and now dupe of creating another threat which is to attack this Pawn on B2 B3 played and an important Point here is that if you play C5 then I can take and even if you take here after Queen A1 white has excellent compensation so you cannot do that that's the reason why dubov goes Rook B4 attacks the D4 Pawn now that this has to be defended somehow otherwise black is going to take back the pawn but also at the same time if you are able to exchange a few pieces that's kind of quite good and that's why Anish goes King F2 and he tells dubo that look if you want to take I'm happy with it you can take it you can take this Pawn but there's a nice movie or he can take with the Rook Bishop takes and then Bishop takes D4 so something like Rook D4 Bishop D4 Bishop D4 would have been good but Dupo actually goes F5 and this is pure dubo style he's attacking the bishop Anish now has a choice where should he take his Bishop should he put it on D3 but he sees that the C6 Pawn is hanging and sees nothing wrong in capturing it so he takes on C6 and dumo sacrifice is a pawn wow a niche looks a little stunned there you cannot take with the bishop because D4 is hanging so he takes the pawn on F4 and E5 photo move by Daniel dubo look if you take gf4 then the queen enters here so that's why he plays D takes E5 still the queen will enter But just to show you what was happening uh otherwise Queen H4 King G1 if you had taken here with the other Pawn like fe5 then there was check here Bishop E5 and Rook G4 with an mate with a mate coming up okay for now King G1 Rook F4 he sacrifices an exchange here wow what a game but the analysis the objective evaluation of the position is around equal but look at anisha's time he's down to a minute he gives a check King achieved the position is around even perhaps Queen E4 but this queen D5 check wasn't the best there was Queen C1 which was much better check King F2 played by Anish and Rook to F4 another piece joins into the attack look at how dubo was attacking with his Bishop Rook Queen and another Bishop unbelievable these two Rooks here on H1 and A1 haven't moved throughout their game yet let's see if they get a chance because dubo is attacking like crazy Queen D5 he gives a check now if you go King G1 then Bishop at six with the idea of sacrificing other rook and Bishop coming in so he goes up now Rook F5 would have been better but he goes Rook f8 an important moment is to go Queen D4 but Anish blunders with Queen C5 this is a mistake Queen F4 check now the King has to go back to F2 but Anish only has 12 seconds left what an attack what an unbelievable attack this is egos King have to presses the clock with just five seconds left dubo has a lot of time he goes gives a check again is he going to repeat not really such a game cannot end in repetition you have to either Checkmate your opponent or lose the game Queen G5 and now the king if it goes to F2 that is Queen G2 check King E3 Bishop H6 Bishop pops out and gives a check so Anish goes to D3 but now the king is right out there completely exposed this gives a check on d8 King has to go to C4 and dubo brings his Bishop back it gives a check where does Anish go next he goes to B5 Bishop f8 attacking the Queen the queen needs to move he comes to C3 well there are many many ways to finish this off the king is too exposed and four black pieces are hounding at the white king check the King has to go to A4 now where else can you go if you go cooking A5 there is Queen d8 check King A6 seems too deep in anime territory King A4 and now dubo finds another classy move Queen E7 is threatening Queen A3 mate Anish has to play A3 and what do you do now now do both actually can finish off the game by simplifying he knows he knows that he's won the game he knows he's played a brilliancy there what an amazing game check takes King B3 check on E6 and this is over because the C6 Bishop is hanging and he resigns look at this amazing game both the Rooks never moved in the game both the white Rooks remain on their initial squares and do both checkmate at his opponent the beautiful thing about this is how both of them are analyzing after the game they're talking in Russian Anish of course knows that he has fallen prey to a dubo masterpiece in fact this game received the best game prize in the tournament it was so beautiful also dubo himself was so proud of this game he wrote on Facebook he doesn't do that often uh brilliant chess I hope you like this game do let us know in the comment section what you found to be beautiful in this one this is

and just all his pieces he's going to play with the black pieces just to give you an idea of what a super Talent this boy is it is said that maybe he is the biggest ever chest star to have come out of Germany after the great Emmanuel Lasker who was the second world champion he's so good and he's going to be tested today against the greatest player on the planet Magnus Carlsen Magnus arrives like always with a few seconds left for the game to kick off he adjusts all his pieces always look at his Knights they face each other imagine this is just all his pieces and his routine is generally consists of getting off his suit and then uh drinking water but this time he does none of that the game begins at Carlson's opens with Knight F3 D5 B3 Bishop G4 so it's the nimzo Larsen attack with B3 Bishop B2 not very popular at the highest level but in Blitz you want fresh positions and that's exactly what Magnus wants to do Vincent goes Knight to D7 he's also choosing a setup which is not very popular but is very logical he wants to get his Knight out here put a spawn on E6 get the bishop out and Castle it out Magnus goes for G3 and he offers Vincent do you want to take on F3 and spoil my structure I'm ready for it because I would get the bishop pair in return Vincent says no thank you I'm going to play E6 Bishop G2 and bring my knight out to F6 so as promised black is played extremely solid chess and now Magnus would most likely Castle but he goes D3 and you will see that in Blitz tournaments players like Magnus who are extremely strong want to create unconventional positions so maybe Magnus does not castle at all keeps his King in the center Bishop D6 and plays Knight B2 now the idea could be to go E4 here but he first plays H3 okay asking a question to the bishop of course you don't want to take here because that would mean that white gets the bishop pair but okay it's not a bad idea to take on F3 uh you could take and then maybe build a strong center with E5 that's what Vincent is thinking about but he places his Bishop back G4 and Bishop G6 and Magnus says I want this bishop I want the bishop pair and I'm going to get it at all cost but in doing so he has kept his King in the center and also lost some time on the board not on the clock on the clock he has 30 seconds more but on the board you can see that you have to make these two moves also get your knight here Winston goes Bishop E5 and he tells Magnus look if you're going to win my Bishop I won't allow you to have the bishop pair I'm going to exchange one of your Bishops that makes a lot of sense because then Magnus won't be left with the two Bishop Advantage but how is Magnus going to react to it is he going to take here on E5 or is he going to push his Pawn to D4 but in doing so he would block his Bishop on B2 well Magnus says it doesn't matter to me I want to keep my Bishop pair he takes on G6 now and Vincent just thinking for a bit The Logical move is always to capture towards the center but he could also open the F while he decides against it he goes H takes G6 now does Magnus how does he continue you you can Castle but you've pushed your pawns a little bit so you are a bit apprehensive there Magnus goes E3 C5 played hitting the center and now maybe what Magnus can do is pop his Queen out and long long castle that could be one of his ideas he goes G5 who hits the Knight hits the Knight and the Knight has to now decide where to go well a very logical place to go is H5 I mean that is the best Square also from H5 it stops white from opening up the king side further Vincent does that and the Knight jumps to F3 this is perhaps not the best move because now after CD4 Vincent is saying that look I have oh Queen takes is there a mate threaten not really because the Knight defends it but now Rook C8 excellent move he's attacking the C2 Pawn what does Magnus do C3 is just a horrible move because your Bishop is blocked you need to do something more interesting or more active you can long Castle you Rook C1 is again very passive move you don't want to be playing Rook C1 but will Magnus long Castle his team does look in some danger right when the C file is open at the same time on the king side how does he create play he can't play at footage oh it goes long Castle he is saying to Vincent I don't believe in your attack I am ready to Castle long and also he connects his Rooks well one of the ideas now is that this Knight can jump to C5 to E4 that would be a very good route for the night first queen C7 a very basic threat of a mate in one Queen takes C2 Magnus wants to bring his Queen back you can see him hovering around the queen but then plays his room he says okay Rook D2 is fine for me he plays his Rook Here and Now what does Vincent do Knight C5 excellent move he wants to go to E4 from E4 he'll hit D2 and F2 Knight jumps back to E1 and it protects the E4 Square now the bishop controls there maybe black can go Queen A5 stuff here let's say queen A5 King B1 and Bishop E5 is a very very interesting move because you can't take the bishop your Rook is hanging so that was a possibility here uh that Vincent can play Let's see what he does he's down to a minute now very little time and he splits so well he's got such a great position you can't push the pawn right now to E5 because D5 is hanging and maybe in some ways he's defending against the D5 Pawn Magnus instantly moves his King to B1 he's making use of that small timely now he has a 20 second lead the time control has a two second increment per move but when you are down to your last few seconds those few seconds move very quickly it's as if there's no time left I think Knight E4 is a possible Pawn sacrifice like Bishop E4 D4 you can play it that way he goes E5 and Magnus doesn't take it he goes Queen G4 because he realized that if he takes your Bishop f8 would trap the queen and so he decided to go to G4 and now D4 played by Vincent he's attacking in the center Magnus has 55 seconds and the point of Vincent is that if you take your take here and take on D4 then the Knight jumps into F4 which was anywhere not able to come into the game but Magnus doesn't take it he goes Knight F3 that's a good move actually it's a very good move because he's putting pressure Here and Now Winston goes D3 this is a mistake because now Rook C1 and black has overextended and he finds a water move by Magnus E4 Knight D4 was strong but he goes back 91. Magnus is still doing okay he was Bishop to E5 trades the bishop Queen takes E5 and now takes and now Knight thinks B3 is a possibility with Queen A1 ideals no he takes on B3 plunders a rogue oh my God Vincent kymar can't believe that he plundered a roof there's the slow motion replay he takes here he just forgot about it and Magnus comes in and chops the rook and Vincent is surprised that was a big blunder and with that the world champion beats Vincent but what a fight by the youngster Magnus discusses the game with the entrance as well that happens a very very exciting battle between a world-class GM and one who's going to soon become one of the best in the world life is full of exciting events but it is our first impressions that we remember best your first diploma your first job in a big company forgettable emotions from the first date the first expensive things you bought when you got your first paycheck and your first Investments with freedom broker Freedom broker look at your favorite brands from A New Perspective foreign"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

adjusts his pieces before the game not worrying about the six seconds that he lost there we have the Louis Lopez A6 Bishop A4 and now Knight to F6 castles Bishop E7 the closed Droid Lopez rookie one are we going to witness Marshall castles D3 that is the D3 variation and now Bishop D2 stopping Knight F5 in order to win this bishop at 6 H3 and also H6 has an idea it stops Knight G5 so you can play Rook E8 that's what Magnus does A3 bishop f8 and now the Knight comes here he puts his Rook on B8 these are all very natural moves in this opening as you can see the players are blitzing it out because they are aware of these patterns the way in which the knight from C6 is relocated to G6 when A4 is played you try to exchange these Bishops you take it back with the Rook a b a b karuana has the open a file but I don't think that is very relevant in this position placed out of the opening but white structure does look a little more solid he plays Queen to E2 I think this is where the game begins actually not really Magnus still blitzing it out because he realizes that the position is literally not very risky you know he pushes his Pawn if you take he wants to bring out his Queen his Bishop is now opened up Knight is well placed maybe could go to F4 at some point karwana taking a bit of his time trying to think what is the way he wants to react to D5 he takes Queen takes and places his Queen to E4 offering a trade of Queens to Magnus no Magnus can decline the trade of Queens with Queen C5 but then why would he want to do that he decides to take it and pawn takes so that you also have space in the centers and now this is a very equal position Rook to C6 you can feel that Magnus is kind of playing for equality also the tournament situation is to his favorite C3 played here solidifies his Center maybe his Knight can now move because earlier the pawn on E5 would hang these are the little small little advantages that Magnus loves to grind and he plays before what he is essentially thinking is that after Bishop B4 Bishop B4 Rook B4 the B2 Pawn would get a bit weak Bishop C3 but now the bishop is very well protecting the pawn bishop D6 now that's a little weird move because I thought he would go Bishop B4 and trade off the Bishops why did he put his Bishop on D6 maybe it's just to solidify his structure here Knight B2 where is this Knight heading to be looking from F1 to E3 to D5 that's what karwana may want to do and Magnus does the same he wants to also get his knight from E6 to somewhere Knight to F1 played well it would be very difficult to imagine one of the players losing this position because they also have a lot of time on the clock and the position is also very easy to play but with Magnus you could never really relax he changes his mind he gets his Bishop to B4 and now asks the question to Fabi do you want to take because if you take my Rook comes in and I attack your B2 Pawn it's a small weakness that I can attack and karwana can feel a bit of pressure you can you can realize that when the position is around equal and the opponent poses you with some problems it's sometimes not so easy to meet them he has some options obviously he can play Rook C1 he can of course take the bishop he can bring his other rook in there's also an idea to just play Rook A2 uh you don't want to lose the font on C3 so it goes Rook C1 takes Rook takes the trade Rooks and Magnus jumps in with Rook B3 notice how Magnus is making very good use of his time he's still at 2 minutes 96 Knight to D2 now this looks a natural move but actually it's not good he should have played his Knight to E3 but now after Knight D2 Rook B2 Magnus attacks the Knight the problem Starts Now one is that the Knight is coming to C5 E4 is hanging D3 is threatened so karwana goes Knight C4 Magnus puts his Rook one square diagonally to the Knight now the Knight cannot attack it easily and as we have seen the idea is Knight C5 suddenly the problems start to mount up also karwana is one minute down on the clock he goes Ruby one a very good move because you want to get active down the D5 that is the best you can do when you are under attack and now maybe Magnus can go Knight C5 attack this Pawn on e4 also he has an idea of Rook C2 which could attack the pawn on C3 so there's something to choose from you can see Magnus playing around with the pieces and plays his Knight to sifa he attacks E4 what does karwana do because you don't want to get passive you know once you start making moves like rookie one that's the end of it you know okay four attacks here and here it's not a good thing you want to keep yourself active you want to play the position and he goes with B2 he offers a trade of Rooks naturally you don't want to take because once you take Knight D2 this is just equal so he goes Rook A4 Knight to E3 Knight takes E4 played by Carlson he's now a pawn up but karwana is ready to jump in with his roof notice he's down to 30 seconds on the clock so with the position being slightly difficult Magnus also pressing on the clock this is how an amazing Blitz player plays now the point is King F3 beautiful move that's a very important defensive resource because now he attacks the Knight you can't take on F2 because this is hanging also F5 is impossible the Knight takes it and although black can take on F2 with the Knight his coordination is broken and then the White Knight Moves In And although your two pawns down G7 is attacked C7 is attacked and this shows why karwana is such an amazing player he finds the best defensive idea here with King F3 and you can see Magnus is not so happy because he wants more from the position he wants that things somehow coordinate but it's not so easy to make that happen he's thinking between going Knight G5 and putting his Knight on E6 and taking on F2 while he takes it Fabby has his move ready Knight to F5 excellent move G7 is hanging and he takes on H3 now he's three pawns up but karwana takes back one and now will he take back the second so yes now he's just one Pawn down also H6 is hanging and the position looks roundabout even H5 player trying to save that pawn but now there are a few ways to to go maybe one is with creating F7 Rook C7 King G6 Knight H4 check you can play that way and the position is around equal but uh for one is down to ten eight sevenths he goes three Knight to G5 Magnus there not so pleased with his position Knight goes to D6 and a very good idea to actually trade off the knights uh because then that would lead to an equalish Rook end game with the active white king Magnus goes Rook C2 and now Knight E4 would have been good but karwana with very little time goes to F5 Rook C6 King F7 and he gives a check and there you see Magnus okay that's a draw it's it's a look of a man who's kind of resigned to a drop but King G6 and this is magnus's last ditch attempt if he takes on at six he's going to take on FC so he takes on C3 King D2 and now goes back wow what a move and sarwana needs to play G4 and you can see Hikaru in the background trying to look at the game he goes King E3 blunder he has to play G4 Now The Rook Knight is trapped and unbelievable scenes here G4 played Magnus takes on X6 and he has won the game because karwana loses on time but even the final position was just lost he's had to play G4 this was a very important moment of the game white checked on H6 and black has moved his King to G6 now karwana took the Knight here and Magnus realized that if he took the Knight F6 would hang and it would be a draw so he took here giving a check and after King D2 he had an option he could take on G3 and go into a position where his opponent had a knight and he had a rook he had three pawns but instead he decided for this small little trick with Rook C8 and this is where his devious trap was set he wanted to go Rook catch it and take this when he would be a clean two pawns up and that's the reason why karwana had to play G4 here now if you take with the King F6 is hanging if you go to h8 here then I have GTX H5 and if you take H6 again F6 hangs if you take on H5 my knight jumps out and somehow you are not able to keep this Knight under troll so that's the reason why G4 was very accurate and necessary but he went King E3 with very little time on the clock which was a blunder because now after Rook h8 it's all over there's no way to get the Knight out it is trapped and black ends up with two extra Pawns in the game he just played G4 but after Rook takes at six takes here uh Rook takes H5 with two extra pawns white is lost life is full of exciting events but it is our first impressions that we remember best your first diploma your first job in a big company Unforgettable emotions from

23-33 at such an advanced stage of the tournament how is a 2300 rated I am doing so well well he is excellent at Blitz this young boy from Uzbekistan he's already beaten Muhammad diaro in this tournament and has shown phenomenal results gaining close to 150 low points how is Magnus gonna fare against him before the game kicks off Knight F6 C4 G6 are we going to witness the king's Indian or the grunfeld my Domino Place Bishop to G7 bg2 and we have the grunfeld on the board now Magnus wants to take the pawn hesitates a bit takes it Knight takes D5 now E4 is a good move here gives white a small Edge but Magnus places Knight to F3 which is also fine black castles and what I like about madamino's strategy here is that he's moving quickly he knows the opening he doesn't waste time here because he knows that time is going to be very crucial in later stages against the world champion Magnus of course knows this position very well but he's thinking about some Sidelines which will throw his opponent off balance should he go Knight C3 here should he play something else he goes Knight to C3 and now Knight comes out to C6 attacking the pawn on D4 E3 is the main line but you can be sure that madamino is well prepared against it so what does Magnus do you can see the time he has two minutes 18 seconds while madamino has full set of three minutes left on the clock what should Magnus do here thinks for a bit still not sure both Bishop F4 hmm and his opponent takes it instantly Knight takes E5 this is the best move to equalize for black Magnus is a bit surprised that his opponent knows this bishop takes E5 Bishop takes E5 and E3 but look at the position guys after this C6 move blunting the bishop on G2 black has the bishop pair here and a clearly fine position out of the opening one can even go on to say that this is slightly preferable for black already but the Mino wants to take on D4 perhaps but then he gives up his Bishop pair does he win a pawn he doesn't get enticed by that he goes Queen E7 which is a very very fine decision a level-headed call Queen to E7 Rook moves to D1 and Bishop comes out to G4 attacking D1 you don't want to be playing a move like F3 and that's why Magnus puts his Rook on D3 and tamino brings his Rook to the center H3 F5 is taken by the Knight so is E6 maybe you can drop your Bishop back to see it keeping the bishop pair but I think the youngster wants to chop off the Knight on D4 and he does it he takes on D4 of course you can't take with the pawn because Bishop F5 would pin so he takes with the Rook Rook takes Pawn takes and now Bishop F5 this is an isolated pawn and definitely black is doing very well here Rook to d8 Rook D1 now something like H5 seems like very solid position for black you can even play Bishop E6 to control the D5 Square this is slightly weak if my Domino was Queen before maybe this allows D5 liquidating move does Magnus want to play that not really he goes A3 Queen to B3 the queen settles down on a good Square it's amazing that this 233 rated IM is actually giving Magnus such a tough fight and he's also ahead on the clock and making great moves G4 played by Magnus the bishop goes back to C8 and now Knight comes out to E4 Magnus slowly starting to turn on the screws is he looking at C5 at F6 the Knight is looking good now madamino has one minute 50 seconds he goes Knight to D5 that's a good move rookie one played by Magnus if somehow he can go to C5 with his Knight then maybe chop off the Knight then his Rook stands on an open file these are some of the ideas that Magnus has on his mind he goes back Queen B6 and I think it's time for Magnus to sink in his Knight to C5 he does so the night is sitting well on C5 and he plays Queen to C7 this is not a great move because now Bishop takes D5 is a strong move but he goes Queen G5 because Bishop D5 would have been nice because you couldn't have taken with the Rook there were problems on the back rank so he had to take with the pawn which would have given white an advantage but Magnus is also a bit rattled here although now time wise he's doing well he's moved ahead on the clock I think it's time to take on D5 perhaps Bishop D5 Rook D5 and then a very nice muruki 7 and Interplex Zone because you can take the queen I can also take your queen I think Magnus is calculating this line but he goes Knight D3 and that's not a great move because now Bishop E6 and black is doing pretty fine Knight C5 will you see it of course black is fine with the draw against the world champion but Magnus wants to win he wants to become the champion and this is a critical game he has the white pieces his opponent is also not a super GM so this is a game he must try and win but now he's down to 44 seconds he's going low on time matamino has one minute 14 seconds he also looks more comfortable here facing the world champion is never easy but he seems to have eased into at night D3 Bishop E6 is Magnus going to repeat not really he brings this queen back the Mino goes B6 he stops the knight from coming to C5 Rook C1 by Magnus trying to put pressure on this weekend C6 Pawn but the queen comes to D6 and now C5 could be on cards what will Magnus do maybe B4 stopping C5 could be an idea but look at the clock magnets down to 20 seconds oh my God how is the world champion going to handle all of this stress his position is not better he's down to his last 10 seconds 95 97 he could have also pushed C5 by the way that was a nice move there takes on C6 Magnus goes for some kind of a tactic here Queen D4 Queen D4 Rook D4 actually it's just an exchange and the position is now around equal maybe even slightly preferable for black now goes for a rook C7 check King H2 now Rook D2 is important but madamino goes rupees seven trading this was not important and G5 fixing the pawns on light Square this little move of course the position is still a draw but this is pure Magnus style in endgame you know he's going to try and press with every little chance that he gets of course this position is still a draw F6 should have been preferred to exchange more pawns but matamino is not playing the end game as well as he was playing the opening and the middle game King E3 played King to C5 and now what does Magnus do he goes King D3 A5 played King C3 and you want to keep your pawns on uh that squares because you have a bishop on light squares but E4 oof why this decision to fix the pawn on the light Square this can become a weakness in future Bishop E6 Bishop E2 but I think what madamino wants to do is he wants to sort of fix the white Pawns Bishop D5 Magnus goes Bishop D7 attacks the pawn B5 Bishop p8 now you can see all the pawns fixed on light squares unbelievable how Magnus magically like a magician has put madamino under pressure but still how to break through because this bishop is attacking B5 defended by the king it's attacking F7 defended by the bishop but I think the white king is coming in from here so he goes Bishop C4 King E4 King B6 and now King to D4 it seems like black is in zuk Swang Bishop C6 King D6 and Magnus comes back what is magnus's winning plan well maybe he's just waiting if the bishop moves he wants to go Bishop D3 attack the pawn if the king moves he wants to enter here still Bishop E6 should be preferred you cannot move the king because then the white king comes inside and then it's all over also coming low on time is down to 20 seconds he's feeling the pressure Magnus Carlsen showing his endgame magic here the world champion is known as endgame God for a reason King E6 blunder here Magnus moves in he knows that he's winning now King comes to C5 King E5 Bishop C6 the pawns are falling on the queen side Bishop B3 Magnus is going to take the queen side pawns but madamino is going to take the king side pawns who's faster here Bishop A4 the bishop Falls he can't exchange he can't exchange he would be too slow he needs to come back he needs to move his Bishop back he goes Bishop D5 but Magnus now trades it because if you move the bishop the F7 Pawn is going to fall Magnus Carlsen has managed to somehow trick his opponent here King F4 trying to come in Pawn pushes A5 King B6 Magnus brings his King in and now F4 stopping the king Side Pawn Magnus knows it was a tough win there mother minov knows that it was a draw and he missed it Magnus is like you it should have gotten the half point there that's the sadness of you know losing a drawn game against the world champion madamino played so well there and he's a talent definitely to watch out for but for now Magnus showing why he's one of the best end game players in the world foreign this is what he wanted so the idea in itself was was sound but like obviously it shows that why the guy is um I mean I mean again shows why he scored so well in the blitz because he played fantastic until then uh but it also shows why he's um a bit low rated in classical because uh clearly like most you know very high rated players they would have uh they would have drawn that game easily not just by by waiting and um I thought as soon as he by the way I thought as soon as he exchanged Rooks I thought that was a really poor decision practically speaking like if he doesn't exchange works like I'm worse like I'm not even I'm not even pretending to be better so like when I went G5 I was thinking like I have 10 seconds I don't care uh I now have some slight chances and uh later I mean I could just feel you know confidence going when he's on time I started to get chances of this one foreign"},

adjusts his pieces gets them ready you know he has this way of adjusting his pieces be careful this is like a great care he wants them on the central squares and off we go E4 by Magnus E5 Knight to F3 Knight C6 we have the rule Lopez A6 Bishop A4 Knight F6 and now the open variation is played D4 is the main move but Magnus goes for a sideline with rookie one takes on C6 dc6 95 well mamidaro has the bishop pair this line is considered to be completely harmless so it seems like magnus's opening choice is more for just surprise value than actual objective uh strength of the opening F6 was played before by Lake Wong Liam against Magnus in an online event but he goes Bishop F6 Magnus adjusts his D4 Pawn F4 is the best move but he plays Knight to C3 and now C5 is the best move to destabilize the Knight and that is exactly what Mom and Yaro does what do you do about the Knight because you can't take on C5 E5 Knight is hanging it's already black has equalized out of the opening Magnus must go Knight to D5 here in order to attack the bishop and get an equal position you must be careful he plays it Knight to D5 good move and now C takes D4 attacking the bishop he takes back with the bishop here notice if you are taken on F6 gf6 would attack your E5 Knight and the E3 Bishop that would have been a blunder mamidaro takes on D4 Queen takes D4 and now just a simple developing move Bishop E6 would mean that you have two push-ups against two knights and a completely fine position as black want to try and win a piece with C6 but it's not possible because Knight takes F6 comes with a check so better idea is just to develop your Bishop that's exactly what Mom and Dad was going to do he plays it and Magnus has a lot of time on the clock he has two minutes 40 seconds generally Magnus likes to think in the opening but this time he's well prepared now you you either get your route to B1 or you take on abstraction what is Magnus going to do he takes his time and he chops off the bishop okay now taking with the queen makes sense yes he takes it and Magnus must play Queen C5 here but those would be one not the most accurate move because quickly brings his Rook now this Knight is unstable notice if you bring your queen to A7 I'll take on D1 Rook D1 and then pick up your knight so you need to keep the Knight under check and queen C5 is Blade Take on D1 root D1 and what a brilliant decision by shakriya he plays rook d8 and Magnus is in trouble look at his time he has two minutes 10 seconds but if he takes on d8 this is what's happening Queen d8 and now there's a mate on D1 you can't really stop the queen from coming there so you play H3 but in comes the check King H2 and then 26 what a nice move pinning here threatening F6 so you take the queen but after you take the Knight has to move and Bishop takes C4 black is a complete Pawn up okay so you can't take on d8 but if you can't take you might want to play rookie one to sort of get your knight defended but then the Rook jumps in attacking F2 and then B2 what do you do next well you play P3 but then I pick up this pawn and you can't take on C7 because Queen F2 is hanging so all in all this is big trouble for Magnus carlsel and he's thinking what to do maybe he can go Rook D4 but then there is B6 suddenly the group cannot be defended oh yes you can play Queen C6 because if you take here there's a mate but I just save my back rank issues and you know I'm completely fine here as black and black is again doing the same thing here F5 and wins the pawn so Magnus Carlsen in big trouble you can see there he's already thought for more than one minute 15 seconds his position is not good Rook F1 is the only move here in order to keep the game sort of in even territory but his Magna is going to play such a passive move oh he finds it's the best move in the position but it's still a very pleasant position for black he can play C6 he can think about Ruby too firstly you can't go Ruby 2 directly because then twin takes C7 is hanging so you may want to just save that pawn with playing Pawn to C6 look at the huge time lead that Shakira mom and yarrow has he has a total of one minute 10 seconds more or 20 seconds more he plays C6 good move Magnus plays Pawn to B3 and now how about just taking care of your back rank with who like H6 that should be possible that's exactly what mamigaro does he plays his Pawn 286 and Magnus wants to move his Queen back he does it he brings his Queen back Queen to F5 played by Muhammad yarrow he's looking at the C2 square but Magnus only has 20 seconds saves his back rank as well plays HP Queen comes into C2 attacking A2 and Magnus jumps in with Queen B6 that's a mistake he should have played Knight F3 and then gone in here but now with Queen B6 Rook B1 is coming in and notice the thread of root D1 because after Queen takes B7 there is Rook takes Rook King takes rook and queen D1 Checkmate so can Shakira find this more Rook D1 and he plays its Magnus Carlson in big trouble he has 40 seconds left he is now just going to lose this game or what because if you take your queen takes me one check King has to move to H2 and then I can simply pin or he takes Queen takes two and there is 26. Magnus Carlsen is losing this his Knight is pinned he needs to play at four to save the Knight yes he's plays it F6 brilliant move by Shakira because now Knight E3 can't go Queen xd3 is hanging if you move your knight here fleetex F4 comes with a check Magnus is going to lose a pawn he's down one minute 20 seconds you can look at the face of Shakira you know that he knows that this is his chance to beat the world champion Knight F3 picks up the Pawn King to G H1 and now just go back Queen B8 save your Pawn on B7 and you are a complete fauna but no Mom and arrow goes for H3 Pawn if you take on H3 F3 Knight is hanging but Magnus can take on B7 and that is counter play will Magnus find that move he has four three two oh he takes it with one second left what a game Queen G3 takes on H3 check your king H2 and another check oh my goodness is this going to end in a draw King G3 moves his King up takes the pawn on A2 but now there is a perpetual he's so sad Magnus shaking his head he's dodged the bullet there what a game this is all of a sudden it's just Perpetual if you come here there's a check on D7 if you go here there's a check on F5 27 Queen G4 and it's a drum mama diaro was dominating the game he still has a complete extra minute on the clock but Magnus Carlsen somehow managed to trick him Shakira still can't believe what an opportunity he has missed to beat the world champion he's thinking about where could he have improved but yes there was a moment where he could have just brought his Queen back and Magnus says that was completely lost and mamadero said I should have pushed my pawns on the king side for sure that was a big mess but it's not so easy to beat the world champion mama diaro tried his best but Magnus life is full of exciting events but it is our first impressions that we remember best your first diploma your first job in a big company forgettable emotions from the first date the first expensive things you bought when you got your first paycheck and your first Investments with freedom broker Freedom broker look at your favorite brands from A New Perspective foreign"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

but Magnus also knows his opponent's style and that is even more dangerous because Carl said is world champion at Psychology goes C4 opens with the English opening yard and responds with E6 it's going to be very interesting to see what opening they choose G3 the fianchetto system in the English D5 Bishop G2 and Jordan now has many options at his disposal Knight F6 C5 he can play any of that but he's thinking for a bit and maybe there is an ambitious option of pushing the pawn to D4 that's what he wants to do well why is it ambitious because you are moving the same piece again in the opening and that wastes time but in return you are getting space which is important so C5 Jordan bolsters His Pawn structure further Carlson tries to break it open this is also a reversed benoni if you look at it where white has his pawns on C4 and D3 and is trying to open things up one thing that Magnus definitely knows is not to fall into Jordan's preparation because he has many new ideas up his sleeve and I think that's the reason why he has played something offbeat here E3 Knight to F6 very logical development by Jordan Magnus takes the pawn C takes D4 and notice how the position has changed now white has a queen side majority here and that's why Magnus wants to expand with B4 also later on there are no checks with Bishop B4 and stuff and Jordan rightly prevents the expansion with A5 it's like a knee-jerk reaction white plays A3 black responds with A5 now you pin the Knight and you maybe just want to get rid of this bishop the reason for that is that white has slightly less space and so when you put your knight on D2 you don't want your Bishop to be hemmed in on C1 and that's why Magnus is even ready to give up his Bishop pair just so that there is Harmony in his position he brings his Knight out on D2 and also the Knight on G1 hasn't developed yet so Magnus is waiting should he put it on F3 which is the most natural but not really he goes 92 and maybe his plan is that at some point the night will come to good use on F4 or he can use his F Pawn until now Jordan's play has been a picture of logic you know he's developed all his pieces he's castled nicely and he's doing really well what does now Jordan do E5 fantastic move he's connected his pawns and already one can say that White's position looks preferable here but Magnus now chops off the Knight why did he do that Bishop F6 is there a specific reason does he want to put his Knight on e4 but then the bishop will simply drop back and push the Knight away with F5 rookie one played by Magnus and Jordan getting ambitious he plays H5 he wants to push H4 and open up the king side a bit and so Magnus says I need to create play on The Queen side he goes C5 his idea is Knight C4 Knight D6 Knight D6 in the air Bishop E6 development looks fine or just push H4 but he he goes Bishop E7 and he attacks the pawn on C5 Magnus simply defends it with Rook C1 and Jordan now has a nice little position rookie 8 followed by baby bishop f8 or H4 sounds so good but he goes A4 he fixes the queen Side Pawn and look at Magnus he's ready to give up his Pawn on C5 because the E5 Pawn would hang and then the bishop would be hanging on C5 but Jordan now makes a blunder he goes Bishop E6 why is this a mistake well because Bishop takes C6 an unusual move because generally white doesn't give up that Bishop B Tech C6 and you take the pawn on E5 is it worth giving up that Bishop it actually is and Magnus takes it look at Jordan's time he has 10 minutes 55 seconds and generally you would take it back right because that looks like the only move not really there's another move Bishop takes C4 the point being that after Bishop B7 your Bishop B3 and then Rook A5 which is a good position for black but Jordan actually takes on C6 and now after 95 white has simply won a pawn bishop G5 played but this is not a good move now even the C6 Pawn is hanging and once again comes as a shock to Jordan because if he plays Queen D7 there is 95 if Queen C7 you can take on D4 and sacrifice an exchange here so a brilliant move by Magnus Queen comes out to F6 but now you can just simply play F4 and save your Rook yes F4 played by Magnus and the Knight on E2 proves its worth here beautiful play uh by Magnus Carlsen Bishop B3 played yes unleashing an attack on the Knight but Magnus knows that if you take the Knight I am going to take your bishop and so in that sense this position is already completely invites favor count the number of Pawns one two three four five six seven for white and five for black so white is already two pawns up Magnus Carlsen knows that if he keeps his King safe he should be taking this one home Queen to D5 played and Magnus now just defends his Pawn on G5 getting ready to play his Knight to F4 attacking the pawn on C5 and now this Knight F4 makes a lot of sense also the time is clearly in magnus's favor 8 minutes 22 seconds and Jordan is down to three minutes the Knight comes to F4 if you play Queen F3 I have always King H2 to defend everything so Queen D7 played and now Magnus is going to play on the light Square as he plays rookie 4 putting pressure here excellent move here and also later on he can bring his Queen to F2 to Bear down on this Pawn on D4 also the H5 Pawn would be hanging so after Rook C6 shall we get greedy and chop off a Pawn on H5 maybe maybe Magnus taking his time in the winning position he's two pawns up he doesn't need to hurry Queen F2 attacks D4 Jordan defends it and now that the queen is close to the white king and everything is secure I think it's time to chop off another Pawn this is three pawns up now for Magnus Carlsen and he has completely beaten demolished his opponent what is very interesting to note is how that little move Bishop takes C6 came as a complete surprise bd5 played by Jordan well is he giving up the fourth Pawn in the position because now Queen takes oh you could even take Queen takes D4 notice this line Queen D4 Bishop takes E4 Queen G7 mate so that is just game over uh I think Magnus is just thinking what is the best way for him to continue and he plays Rook takes D4 which is also fine I think Queen D4 would have ended the game faster but now Rook D4 and Ma and he brings this queen back well four points down that's a lot of material and I think Magnus would be ready to give up one Pawn or so to sort of simplify things that's exactly what he's doing after Rook takes Queen takes now just chop on D5 he takes with the Knight Rook takes and now maybe Rook takes A4 getting back another Pawn but also Rook takes D5 is fine because Queen and him are tricky but when you have three extra pawns you don't really have to worry Queen E4 played and now Queen to D2 the pawn is simply moving ahead a better defense could have been Queen B3 King H2 Queen D3 but after Queen E4 Queen D2 Queen F3 Magnus puts his King on H2 Jordan tries to block the pawn but now Magnus knows he can make progress with his King side pawns well actually if you think about it the queen side pawns are blocked because of this Pawn so Magnus is attacking it now Jordan defends it with Queen B5 his uh deep Pawn can start rolling but the B2 Pawn is hanging so a little bit of care needs to be taken and you can see Magnus is not too pleased there is some resistance by his opponent he's also down to two minutes 40 seconds but I think it's time to use your king side majority now because the d-pawn has really blocked the black queen so H5 good move by Magnus just getting ready to get a passer from the King side and now uh Jordan also defense is not so easy to to make moves here and he attacks the pawn on H5 with Queen F3 not so easy to defend it actually but H6 seems like a good plan here so that everything is defended look at the screen defending B2 defending D4 defending at six at 6 played and now Jordan just trying to think what is the way in which he can still try to resist well it's not at all easy he gives a check Magnus I always love how Magnus plays winning positions he's a picture of concentration you know this comes from experience this comes from the fact that you've got got your hands burnt on several occasions in winning positions and you know not to celebrate too soon and so now D5 the Deep Pawn is moving forward there's the H Pawn which you have to worry about all of this being protected by this queen uh wonderful piece by the way Queen E4 check and now just simply King H2 and Jordan resigns Magnus Carlsen wins and listen to the discussion between these two players thank you

and it's three minutes plus two seconds increment off we go Knight F3 Knight F6 D4 will have the king's Indian per episode 92 his idea is to play E4 here and Anish allows it we are going into perk territory and Bishop B5 check very interesting to provoke C6 and go for this and Anish plays C5 interestingly the same opening line was played between both these players in an online game just a few days ago so they are all well booked up they had reached this position nihal had gone H3 in that game let's see what nihal does here does he play the same line no he goes Rook E1 this time that's why both the players were making their moves pretty quickly here because they were well aware of theory Anish plays B6 the idea is to put the bishop on B7 one of the small edges that white has is that the Knight on C6 cannot go to D4 or D4 the pawn on C3 dominates it so that's not a great night sitting there but at the same time how should white continue a good idea could be to push the pawn to E5 and then if you go Knight to G4 here then you can play on Knight to C4 but nihal plays it safe he goes Knight F1 and he says maybe my knight goes to E3 to D5 or it goes to g3 at the same time he's opening up the diagonal of his Bishop for Anish now putting his Bishop on B7 seems like a no-brainer that seems a normal move connecting his Rooks but also you could go to G4 like both players now beginning to think like G4 oof interesting Anish wants to put pressure on H2 perhaps but more importantly he's trying to control the E5 square with both his pieces and that's his idea but if nihal plays H3 which he does Knight G5 and he takes maybe bishop F4 was also possible and now Knight takes how about Bishop F4 not really nihal says I'm going to put my Bishop back next move I have F4 E5 coming in now a very important move is A5 to prepare Bishop A6 but Anish goes Bishop B7 this is not a good move but why Knight G3 nihal why not push your Pawn to F4 and then E5 well I'm not so sure he should have played that he goes Knight G3 and now Anish giri can play C4 he goes A5 interesting that's a very good move Anish better late than never realizes that he should go Bishop A6 and now nihal even though he would go ff4 which he does it's a bit too late because Bishop A6 is coming in very nice now the Knight cannot jump to D3 but actually the other Bishop can pop out on this diagonal and pin the pawn but will Anish find it wow he finds it look at how both these Bishops are standing on A6 and H6 limiting White's position at the same time the Knight is looking at D3 Square The Rook is ready to move to d8 very interesting play by Anish giri and he seems to be doing quite well also nihal is taking a lot of time in his on his clock he cannot play FX E5 the queen is hanging he needs to move the queen but where if you go to F3 the Knight controls it if you go to F2 then the Knight jumps into D3 so it's not easy to realize where to play or play a queen and that's why nihal taking his time this might be a critical moment for him to think because Black's next move is pretty simple if you don't do nothing he's going to play Rook ad8 so Knight a queen F2 is logical Knight D3 takes takes and this has happened look at this move Knight to F5 GFI Queen G3 check and you win the bishop on D3 but nihal doesn't go for it he plays F5 Bishop takes C1 Rook takes C1 and now centralizing his Queen with Queen E5 Black's position is very very nice but also nihal is doing pretty well he can move his Queen and look at this idea the Knight on edge G3 is doing nothing much here so how about we reroute it from H1 to F2 but that's such a tough idea to foresee and with nihal having only 43 seconds it's not at all easy meanwhile the bishop on D3 is pretty okay placed he grows Rook 88 and nihal finds it Knight H1 played wow with 39 seconds a grand master generally finds the best squares for his Knight that is exactly what nihal does Knight H1 played and now Anish needs to decide he has a very nice move GTX F5 because after he takes F5 he can go Queen E3 rookie 3 and Bishop F5 that would be a very good way to continue but I guess gf5 there is Queen G5 check Queen G7 Queen F5 let's just play through that and we reach here oh he offers a drop he offers a draw with an extra minute and he tells nihal that Queen G5 was a problem Queen G7 Queen takes F5 and he's not too happy with a smile on his face he tells nihal this position looks complex according to the engines it's perhaps slight Advantage for black but Anish is okay with the draw he had an extra minute there but he didn't want to risk it and here nihal says he should have played E5 somewhere both players discuss and this is the nice thing about our Niche always he likes to talk to his opponent and get thoughts about the game no matter whether he wins loses or draws he's always there to analyze a very interesting game very short game 24 moves but a lot to learn from this uh unleashes decision of A5 Bishop A6 and nihal's Knight H1 Knight F2 it's very interesting maneuvers life is full of exciting events but it is our first impressions that we remember best your first diploma [Applause] your first job in a big

handshake both are good friends of each other in fact dubo has helped Magnus to prepare for his world championship match against nepo Carlson as always adjusts all his pieces that's his routine to get into the zone for the game and there you have it 15 minutes plus 10 seconds increment Magnus with the white pieces dubo known as a creative genius what is Magnus going to play B3 he plays the little pawn move at the corner of the board against dubo dubo has that nice little smile both of them must have played many Blitz Games on this opening also would have some prep against it so it's very interesting to see what do both plays and here he goes for the smooth G6 interesting generally Knight F6 is the main move he wants to play his Bishop to G7 and that's why Magnus starts to think a bit he plays his night out to F3 attacking the E5 pawn and dubo defends it in comes see 4 this is a very well known line Knight G7 played and now an interesting Pawn sack variation could be B4 because you want to play B5 and if Knight takes B4 then Knight takes E5 is hanging so that is playable but Magnus I guess is thinking not on those lines perhaps he is he's not making his move perhaps B4 is not such a silly idea after all but the other main move of course is to play D4 here right in the heart of the position and if white were black were to go E4 you are more than happy with Knight B2 and that's exactly what Magnus does D4 is played and dubo knows his stuff he takes on D4 Knight takes D4 interesting move now notice that if you reach a position like Knight D4 Bishop D4 here this is clearly better for white so he castles and now the idea here for Magnus can be to take on C6 because if you take back with the Knight I take on G7 King G7 and Knight C3 and this is a very solid Edge for white Hugo Bishop E2 you Castle Queen D2 Rook D1 very easy to play so once you take on C6 then he must take with the deep Pawn oh Magnus takes it because even if you take with the B Pawn then there is takes takes Knight C3 which is better for wife will do both take with the d-pawn well he does it and he does it with such ease you know dubo makes tough decisions quite easily and this is quite simple for these top GMS even though you have doubled your pawns you know that your Bishop is coming out and that's very important quindiate rook d8 and now Magnus takes on G7 King G7 let's take stock of this situation white has three pawns here black has four Magnus brings his Knight out very logical there is a majority that white has on the king side against three pawns here A5 played by do both but now notice you want to play A4 at some point but the Knight is defending against it so how do you engineer it think about it if magically you could transfer your knight to C5 that would be epic but the that is one square diagonal for the Knight and that takes literally four moves to achieve so dubo might not do that it may take too much time but we'll see Bishop E6 played now many players would short Castle but here Magnus plays F3 because he realizes that his king would be better placed on F2 than castling all in all this is a dangerous position to play against Magnus especially because Black's Queen side majority is not going to be very active and also he doesn't have a bishop pair to compensate for it which generally happens in the Berlin King F2 played by Magnus and I love this move by dubo he is going on this night Journey Knight G8 Knight F6 Knight D7 Knight C5 wow you know the Knight was not doing much on E7 it couldn't go to D5 not couldn't go to F5 so Knight G8 played and now Magnus brings his Rook to the center maybe he will exchange one pair of Rooks not both I am really excited to see how Magnus is going to press in this position because you know you have some ideas like H3 G4 you also have ideas like F4 E4 so a lot of plans here for white meanwhile black has to wait wait for the opportunity to push A4 that's where his real counter play lies or maybe B5 if he can engineer it right now it looks very tough Rook takes Rook Rook takes rook and now Knight comes out to F6 dubo knows what he's doing he's going to D7 he's going to C5 he has covered halfway path to C5 with his Knight with Knight G8 Knight F6 now one idea that I really like for white is H3 because then your idea you are playing G4 here or maybe G3 H for you you just ready to do this but look at magnus's move Rook D4 what is the plan let's think about it I think what Magnus wants to do is he wants to play F4 and then E4 at the same time he's provoking C5 because C5 means that you can go back with your rook and then the D5 Square opens up for the Knight also Knight B5 Knight A4 comes into the picture dubo not tempted with C5 he goes Knight D7 and Knight C5 is coming up next Magnus does play F4 again if you had gone E4 directly then I believe dubo would have pushed this Pawn to F4 and gotten his Knight to E5 with complete control so Magnus first goes F4 preparing E4 with every pawn exchange his majority starts to get in motion that's what his idea is dubo has 13 minutes still left both the players playing pretty quickly now Knight C5 the point here is that A4 now becomes possible yes A4 can be met with B4 but first Magnus is like do both A4 comes later first it's my breakthrough with E4 Knight takes Knight takes Pawn takes okay now do you want to play King E3 and take here I don't think it's really any good because instead of defending the spawn you can play for so Magnus must take this rookie for attack the bishop uh and he does it and once this notice you can't go Bishop F5 there's rookie seven check so you need to defend this bishop with King F7 or King F6 he goes King F7 and now A4 is a real threat imagine you try to take back the D file here then A4 and A3 great compensation and great play for the on the queen side so he goes A4 now Magnus is stopping A4 but at the same time he has fixed his pawns on light Square imagine a bishop coming to F5 and then to C2 so Rook d8 played very simply bringing the Rook into the game Magnus comes up King E3 now he wants to trade Rook D4 and go into a pure Bishop end game what is that if you go into the pure Bishop end game dubo is like I am all ready for it Bishop F5 Magnus you want to trade Rooks please go ahead Magnus does it you can avoid it with rookie 8 check but we'll do both trade because notice if you take take then after G4 you can start getting play on the king side King takes D4 Bishop goes to to attack the B3 Pawn but okay Magnus can of course defend it with King C3 he plays it and I like dubo's next move Bishop E4 not giving any time to White hitting the G pawn and once that pawn is defended you can push C5 and fix all the pawns on the light Square so if you don't do that maybe there's a chance that white might play C5 and there you have dubo very coolly and calmly in his typical style playing C5 now can you trade the Bishops here Bishop D3 Magnus offers it course dubo shouldn't take it if you take take this is completely lost position King comes up you get a past Pawn here so dubo has to avoid it this end game is not without dangers for black what does he do here because next up you want to create a passer Dupo goes Bishop F3 allow this move attacking the G4 Pawn pushing it to G5 even if you played H3 I would have forced you to push G5 in any case but now look at this dubo looking away from the board because whenever you are making long-term plans like fortresses you think in the distance and that's what dubo is doing he realizes that even if he puts his Bishop on F5 and Magnus takes it at gf5 that seems like a fortress because both these squares are taken up by the pawns King D2 and so you could play Bishop F5 B6 played first and uh now if Bishop comes to F5 think about it Bishop C2 Bishop F5 and you take then then I take King E3 King E6 H4 King back H5 now very important to play the move at six provoking G6 and playing this this is a draw but imagine you are careless and you play King G7 here this is lost because after F6 the white king comes from here and breaks through in this fashion and white wins so Magnus of does not even take it he thinks of he has thought of all these possibilities he moves his Bishop away and he tells do both I don't want to go into the end game dubo says okay if you don't want to go that's completely fine with me I'm just going to keep moving my king your King has no entry point over here on e4 and D4 so you cannot make progress and you can feel it from the body language that Magnus thinks it's going to be a draw he pushes his Pawn to H4 is introducing the H Pawn going to make any difference not really H5 blade and now uh once again very important that after Bishop C2 you do not take here on C2 because after King C2 King comes up you sack upon King F4 get a passer and you are winning so you need to keep it there and there's the bishop trade here giving a protected passer is fine because the king can protect it there's no entry point and the players agree to a draw beautiful defense by dubo really loved his maneuver of the Knight E7 to G8 to F6 to D7 that was so cool and both players discuss with each other Magnus also knows he had very little chances because dubo played so well and uh it was a good attempt by the world champion but was not successful a great draw by

Knight on C6 it's the exchange variation maybe the delayed exchange variation you can say Knight to D2 and ding castles Magnus plays his Pawn to Eve A4 this is his preparation he wants a fresh position maybe B3 Bishop B2 the Knight can jump to C4 it's a standard position here but also you may want to gain more space with pushing the pawn to A5 so perhaps ding may want to stop that move by Magnus and he does so by pushing his own Pawn to A5 here now one of the common plans in this position is to get your knight from C5 to E6 but then you are Pawn on E5 is hanging so you push your Pawn to F6 as black as white Magnus goes B3 and you can see ding following this plan he wants to come to E6 with his Knight but Magnus says I'm coming for your Bishop's ding I'll come to F5 you take with your Bishop you lose that otherwise I'll take on E7 he gets his Knight here ding is like be my guest take that Bishop but my knight on E6 is well placed looking at two crucial squares on D4 and F4 Knight jumps to C4 and now how does Bing continue because you may go to F4 but then the bishop is looking there he goes B6 does Magnus really want to take this bishop or not because if he is a little bit delaying that then the bishop can come out to see if a Magnus takes it Queen takes E7 and now black does not have the bishop pair but what has happened is that the Knight is well placed the Bishops are of opposite colors 93 played by Magnus and perhaps for doing a good idea is to put his Bishop on B7 then play C5 but the Knight is coming to F5 and if given a chance to open up with F4 that could mean trouble that's why dingo's G6 stopping Knight F5 for the time being time wise both players have roughly around 4 minutes and a few seconds Bishop B2 played by Magnus his Bishop is not doing much on this diagonal right now but if at some point you can engineer a successful F4 that Bishop would be an absolute monster on B2 now how does ding continue maybe he can put a spawn on C5 and then the bishop comes to B7 he does it he places his Pawn on C5 and he's not afraid of the knight jump to D5 because that would just mean moving his Queen Once so it does not impact him that he has weakened his B5 square a bit the nice thing about this time control is that you have more time than three plus two which is the common time control in Blitz right now but this is part of the grand chess tour and in that five plus three is a very common time control for Magnus he's trying to find a plan for himself he sees that Knight Defy is definitely a doable move but the problem is there's nothing much after that after the queen moves so he goes Queen D2 ending instantly brings his Bishop to B7 saying that now no longer Knight D5 possible Rook d8 played F3 because Bishop takes E4 was threatened with this pin here now for ding he's thinking about what to do he's he's happy with his Knight he's happy with his Bishop he's happy with his Rook Queen Rook everything but what about the king can being think about moving his King here but that might be a bit too much like who who thinks about moving your king there uh you just want to make King G7 is is definitely one idea ding taking his time because he's going to come up with something bold it feels thinking for quite some time he's almost ready with his move but he is making his final calculations Magnus Carlsen knows that his position is pretty cool he wants to bring his Queen from F2 to H4 and King F7 what a move Magnus stops in its tracks by the way this move is not just a very very interesting move because Bing wants to bring his King to see it it's the king walk or should I say the ding walk here and Magnus has stopped in his tracks because that is something he did not expect he gets two pieces in his hands and he's like how do I take advantage of this King which is starting to warn the rear he is in the center can I open up the position with F4 but then Knight is well placed also playing D4 is not at all possible with these two pawns Knight and Rook so all in all the king might have a safe passage away to see it and what an idea let's see if the execution will be as good as the idea there Magnus is now down to 2 minutes 30 seconds and he has to speed up maybe he also wants to bring his King out and perhaps put it on that side that could be an idea but Magnus is an uncompromising player if he sees that this does not feel right to him he will take his time and try to refute that move but ding's move is very good even the engines approve of it so Magnus kind of reluctantly goes to Queen F2 because ding's Journey with the King continues he goes King E8 Queen H4 and it's time to continue the journey you can go King D7 Kings yet but also very interesting is to play Rooks Rook D7 and move your king away to C8 ding plays his King to D7 wow look at that King it has already moved from G8 to F7 Epson to E8 E8 to D7 and if it gets to see it and be it it would be the safest King in the world and then once the king is tucked away black will not hesitate in pushing his kingside pawns down the board and opening up the position for the bishop on B7 Magnus clearly not comfortable with what's going on otherwise he would have made his moves faster he is thinking whether he should punish ding for this Liberty that he has taken with his king or should he just continue normally because there are many moves that you can play normal chess but generally when your opponent tries to move the king in the opening or in the early middle game it is something that you want to punish as white but how do you punish it there's only one break that's possible and that is F4 and it is firmly guarded so what needs to be done well Magnus down to just one minute now on his clock he has a few more seconds but he's coming down and he plays F4 wow Magnus Carlsen says to ding look your king is in the center and by hook or by crew I'm going to open up the position for ding look at the calmness the way in which he thinks he is such a cool and collected composer sort of composed guy and now maybe we can take on F4 with the Knight maybe we can take with the pawn what should we do but if we take with the pawn then Knight D5 is a very powerful move that Magnus has prepared and that's why dingo's Knight takes F4 and Magnus sacrifices Rook wow Rook takes F4 he takes F4 and now Knight jumps to G4 it's not so easy to protect this Pawn on F6 you have one attacker two attackers and three attackers and it's not so simple to to face it so how does ding go he has two minutes 10 seconds to figure this all out and beat Magnus Carlsen clearly he's better the best idea here could be G5 but also to keep in mind the C4 break because the biggest advantage of C4 break is that it weakens the structure here and also prepares Queen C5 check in many of the variations there what does Bing do now does he play G5 or not the other option here is to play F5 and kind of trade the Queens but then after 95 King E8 it's not so clear and he goes for G5 good move played there and Magnus needs to speed up he's down 57 seconds on the clock he he needs to move faster but how can you do that Queen H6 good move keeping up the pressure on the F6 point now a good good suggestion here would be to play C4 because after Bishop F6 you have Queen C5 check D4 Queen B4 hitting the rook and it's very difficult here so but dingo's Queen E6 Knight F6 check and the King goes back and now after Queen G5 Magnus has picked up couple of pawns for ding maybe Rook D6 is the correct move but he goes F3 wow what a move point is if you play gf3 Rook G8 wins the queen year so Magnus plays Rook F1 attacking the pawn but will ding Now find Rook G8 and give up an exchange because he is Pawn down here and he goes for it he finds Rook G8 he plays it he's not sort of attached to his material he's ready to give it up at the right time and now the queen is hanging uh also G2 is hanging so we have to be very careful here maybe the best move now is to play Queen F6 to offer a queen trade but he does so via E5 and now Rook G2 King moves to H1 somehow if the queen can get to H3 it would be a nice idea but look at this if you go Queen H3 Queen E8 is simply game over there's a Checkmate which you have to observe closely as black if you want to win this game and also 50 seconds for ding 36 seconds for Magnus Carlson the best move here is Queen G6 controlling E8 not exchanging the Queens ending finds it wow with just 44 seconds on the clock ding Legend has found the move and if you go Queen check here then King D7 is completely fine for black and if Bishop C1 then you have F2 with the idea of Rook G1 coming up so Magnus with just 16 seconds needs to move needs to move in the background it seems like Wesley so has arrived looking at the games but with nine eight seven six five four Magnus has to make a move he plays H4 which is a very interesting because now there are no back rank issues but clearly the hg3 square has been weakened and after Queen F4 how do we continue welding says thank you for the pawn I'm going to chop one also attack your bishop and he goes Bishop here Rook G1 comes back with his rook and now Magnus plays Queen E3 but after Queen to G3 it's a first mate Magnus Carlsen resigns ding Legend has beaten Magnus with an amazing king walk let's listen to what ding has to say about it I guess your career way to improve my position H5 27 but I just I had to wait here okay so you you you decided that you have to get your king out yeah this was really a very interesting idea yes at least if I can finish my complete my friend I will be better I have better chance if you can get your king here yes I think black is better have you seen this idea before or you found it over the board yes okay you know this already okay any game that comes to your mind or you just studied it I think for for Magnus this would have been surprised that you ran away with the King and uh he sacrificed upon considering 95 I can break but uh you oh okay yeah it's sacrifice exchange yeah but it didn't look very strong yeah yes yes"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an

ding is better right now because he has two minor pieces for The Rook a very good move is to play his Rook to B4 putting pressure on these pawns that is exactly what Bing does a fantastic move now vishi can't hang on to his extra Pawn here so he takes on A5 and ding can take the pawn attacking the pawn on B7 and The Rook on C6 and he does so Knight takes A5 and which he is going to lose his extra Pawn as well because after Rook takes B7 here's an interesting variation you can't go King C8 I give you a check and then a discovered check and then the bishop comes here and you lose the Rook so there you have it ding takes on B7 you have to go back to E8 now a nice move is Knight C4 because you are looking at the D6 Square later on and the Knight is well placed there but instead dingo's Knight B3 which is fine which is not bad here's an important thing to note if the Rooks are traded it's beneficial to Black because then it will be a rook versus two minor pieces which is not easy to convert but until the Rooks are on the board white is clearly better because he can create huge threats against the black king and that's the reason why you can see vishy playing his Rook to E8 because what he wants to do is he wants to come to E7 and trade off the Rooks for ding now it might be a very good idea to start bringing in his Knight into the game and then to F5 and that is what he does great move by Ding and the pawn can also move forward now Anand wants to play rookie seven he does it he does it of course ding doesn't exchange he understands these things pretty well which he wants to bring his Rook back on E8 but taking his time for now ding is ahead on the clock he has 5 minutes 40 seconds and now Anand plays King F5 but can ding go to F5 with his Knight you can see was she not happy there I think he he wanted to play rookie 8 then he went King F7 and Knight comes to F5 but there is a move Rook D7 stopping Knight D6 check for the time being and black is still Clinging On why it is clearly better but there's no clear way to break through and that's why dingo's H5 look how his Edge Pawn actually cramps all these pawns on the king side which she plays Rook to A5 and his point is that now if the Knight moves then he can pick up the pawn on H5 but there is a check here on D6 and that's exactly what ding does he gives a check King comes up now threat is to take the Knight on D6 and Knight B5 blocking but now Anand has a new strategy up his sleeve he started to make his moves quickly he's threatening to enter here and King G2 fantastic move by ding that's the best move King G4 attacking the H5 Pawn you must push it to H6 can ding do it you look at the time ding is now down to a minute vishy has started playing not just his opponent but also the clock G5 plane Bishop has to move back Bishop E3 that's what ding does and look at Anna and he's played King H5 attacking the pawn on H6 a very good move now is Rook B6 so that if you take on F6 I can take the pawn on F6 A variation can go something yes ding finds it can go something like King at 6 Rook F6 King goes back you move and save your night again now the G5 Pawn is hanging and that way it would be better so vishi does not take on at six he goes to G6 and defends his Pawn he asks ding what is your plan now it seems like White's coordination is a little bit of King F3 is the best move but dink blunders here he goes G4 and why is this a mistake because Anand has to find Rook A4 and he does so beautiful move attacking the pawn but what if simply defends it well there which he shows his plan he pins the Knight and this is such an irritating pin now being should go Knight A7 quickly and exchange this because if he goes Knight C3 now the problem is after take take there's Rook D3 and you lose the Knight all of this is a big problem he goes King F3 this is still equal but now vishy has things under control and also look at the time he has four extra minutes things have turned tremendously and Arnold knows he smells that he has a chance here Rook D3 He wants to double down the B file and win this Knight Bing must quickly go for Rook D6 nobody goes Rook B8 who he wants to give Rook G7 checks so if you go Rook B3 he goes Check and now he's King at six there's Knight D6 and if you go King F7 there's Rook G7 so wishy first plays your king takes at six and he's like now ding you don't have a check you're still pinned very badly and there you have being now down to 10 seconds shaking his head he's unhappy oh he has to find Rook B6 which is the only move he finds it F6 is hanging now Wishy goes and defends the pawn now for only movies Rook D6 he must find it so that to break the pin and equalize the game the game is then drawn but being now down to four seconds does not find it it seems like one second he goes rugby eight blunders which he plays Rook B3 King check King F7 and now the Rook is attacked the Knight is attacked and ding Legend can't believe from a completely winning position he has watched this up Wishy really finding all the best moves and resignation what a victory for vishi Anand"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an

both take on each other Lebon has the white pieces and off we go E4 by Levon E5 by Arjun very solid Knight comes out to F3 and Knight C6 are we going to see the rule Lopez or the Italian well Italian it is Bishop to C4 Arjun develops his Knight and Levon plays The Very solid D3 system it's a very solid opening with Bishop C4 Bishop C5 and all these symmetrical stuff but the only difference is that there's a knight on C6 while white has put a Pawn on C3 and with that white hopes to claim for a small Edge out of the opening Levon brings his Rook to E1 the plan is simply to get his knight from D2 to F1 to G3 later first a little pawn move on the king side H3 and a typical regrouping move to bring the Knight to G6 because the Knight on C6 was anywhere not doing much and there you have it the Knight comes to G6 this is well known stuff there have been several games that have reached this position now Leon brings his Bishop back to D3 and just defends the pawn on e4 it's a very slow maneuvering game and also it's both sides have to be very careful how they build this up C6 played by Arjun and now the queen goes to C2 one way that black can start playing is to get the Knight to H5 and then to F4 Levon brings his Bishop to E3 notice how he defended his Pawn on e4 brought his bishop and now wants to get his Knight to D2 but Arjun is beginning his play on the king side with Knight H5 with the Knight coming here and the queen coming out and the bishop looking here it can lead to a dangerous attack Levon has to remain careful here as you can see Levon is taking some time on the clock here and goes Knight D2 he finishes his development but can Arjun Simply Now jump in with his Knight most likely Levon would then go Bishop F1 but Arjun first plays Bishop C7 his plan could be to go for the D5 break the bishop now drops back to F1 good move by Levon he is getting ready for a night jump to F4 but Arjun brings his other Knight to F4 this is actually a blunder because now Levon can go G4 and then Knight moves Bishop F4 and E5 and it's already a huge huge Advantage but Levon doesn't do that he plays A4 which is not the best move he should have played that G4 and look at Arjun he's pushed his Pawn to G5 there you have it arjuneri guy see going for an all-out attack on the king side while Levon playing on the queen side this is such an exciting encounter what would what would Arjun do now King h8 Rook G8 Queen Here pawn push he first brings his Queen out to F6 which is a strong move Levon is under great pressure here he wants to play G3 and kick the Knight off but then the H3 Pawn Falls so it's actually not so simple what to do and so he plays his Pawn to C4 but that doesn't solve his King side issues does it now Arjun can push his Pawn to G4 or he can bring his King to h8 and then Rook G8 what does he do Arjun pushes his Pawn to G4 H takes G4 and brings his Bishop in with one two three and four pieces around the King this is turning into a very dangerous attack Levon must remain careful maybe one way is to get his Knight out from here but he goes G3 and he's like get your knight out from here but you know what the Knight doesn't need to move because when you take this Pawn takes and the bishop is trapped there you see Arjun not even moving his Knight it goes to h8 and his plan is to bring his Rook to G8 played here and now what do you do as Levon is under big pressure here he brings his Knight to H2 but he knows that he is in massive trouble Rook comes in now one more piece joins the attack it's five pieces which are getting into the attack King 2 H1 played and now Arjun can simply double his Rooks Rook G6 Rook here because you are really not afraid of this this capture on F4 Knight comes back to E6 Arjun actually moves his Knight away he wants to put his Knight on D4 which is also a beautiful Outpost for the black pieces in all ways Arjun has a brilliant position here Bishop comes to G2 and the Knight jumps in to D4 here the queen is attacked next and where does it move Levon plays his Queen to B2 and makes the best move of the game he offers a draw to Arjun well Arjun need not take it he can push A5 he can play B6 he can do many things but Arjun is leading the tournament and he accepts the draw Levon is like okay this is just better for you we both know it why did I do all these things and it's such a nice animated discussion between the two of them well Arjun Drew this game more from the perspective of the tournament standing Levon made a smart move because he was under big pressure but water game it was it lasted only 24 moves but already both sides were winning at some point here and that just goes to show what this rivalry is between Levon and Arjun games with between them are so much fun to watch we hope that they have many such games in the years to come foreign"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

board Magnus Carlsen essaying it against the five-time world champion vision and of course Magnus himself multiple time world champion and the strongest player on the planet which he takes on F4 and doubles white spawns and now he attacks the pawn here and asks Magnus to defend it Magnus does so with the move G3 notice if you had played 95 here Queen B4 would have been a very strong option so okay G3 B6 played by vishi and now his idea is to actually exchange the bishop here by going to A6 that's what his plan is very smart Magnus plays C3 and he's like okay vishy if you come to A6 I'm not developing my Bishop yet on F1 and so vishi also smartly castles and he's like Magnus if you come to D3 now then I will play Bishop E6 Bishop A6 and you would have lost a Tempo so for Magnus the most natural move of course is Bishop D3 but he doesn't want to lose this Tempo battle so another idea here could be Knight E5 just plonking the knight in the center which is a good move here possible very much so and then uh you can continue other ideas include maybe pushing the pawn to H4 as a one possibility you can also think about playing your Pawn up to A4 or even A3 and you know it doesn't make much sense that you put your Pawn here it's just about the tempo but you can see is burning his time he has a bishop in his hand he's sort of swiveling it he's trying to figure out what would be the best way I'm sure that he has these moves like h495 A4 playing in his mind at the same time he's calculating Bishop D3 Bishop A6 can I take here this Knight is a little bit loose can I attack it maybe Queen E2 then the Knight goes back and all these assessments are going on in his head but he's not so happy with it which is the reason why he has dropped down to 3 minutes 30 seconds now moves forward hoping that he can actually fight for an edge here somehow can he do so well he puts his Bishop finally on D3 and look at the psychology here guys if Magnus had played Bishop D3 within few seconds wish he would have responded immediately with Bishop A6 I'm pretty sure but because Magnus took one minute 30 seconds which he also is making sure that he doesn't have some Bishop at seven stuff happening here finally he goes for Bishop A6 which is correct because now you have traded your bad Bishop for White's excellent bishop and black has absolutely no issues out of the opening Queen attacks the Knight the Knight moves back to B8 all good now Magnus plays his Knight to E5 keeping the options open if he wants to Castle short or long C5 which he hits the center now what you don't want as black as white is that black takes twice on D4 that's why he plays his Knight so that if you take here he can take back with his Knight okay which he goes in with Knight E4 now Magnus says I'm going to Castle you know that's that's the best place for my king I'm not going for any long castling business and Anand pushes the Knight away with F6 notice this Moon Knight C4 hitting the queen you can't take because E4 is hanging and after Queen D7 you have Knight E3 but Magnus decides to go the other way he could have gained a Tempo with Knight C4 but he goes Knight G4 and now which he can simply develop his final piece knight C6 the position is roundabout even and both sides have three minutes for Magnus on the clock and wishes 4 minutes 26 seconds so that means Anand does have an edge on the clock take on C5 you want to take back with the pawn great move by Anand controlling the central squares you want to put your Rook on B8 attack the B2 Pawn Magnus goes here he's attacking the Queen the threat is Queen takes E4 detects E4 and maybe Rook D6 so rookie d8 definitely makes a lot of sense you know not committing to any move keeping these pawns as they are because they limit the white Knights terribly you know the white Knights are like I want this Square I want this square but no the pawns are all protecting it so wishy actually is in a fantastic position after 17 moves in the London system and that's a great achievement by Anand because Magnus is known to be a very good uh player in the London system now Anand taking his time he is thinking about moves like Rook d8 he doesn't want to move his Queen back again um one more option could be to push the pawn to F5 in doing so you cement your knight on e4 but you give up the E5 square and that could become critical well and then plays a fine Magnus instantly jumps to E5 now you might say but the E5 square is an outpost so is the E4 Square not really guys because the E4 Knight can be kicked away with F3 but that is not possible with the Knight on E5 and Magnus now strikes in the center he wants vishy to go D4 now notice if the pawn goes to D4 you can take take bring your knight and place it on D3 why would a knight on D3 be so strong because on D3 it blockades the past pawn attack C5 Knights are the best blockaders of past pawns that's the reason why vishi is reluctant to play the move d4 although he would get a past on there he takes on E5 Knight takes on E5 now the Knight is well placed in the center and next move you want to kick it away with the F3 move Anand with 2 minutes 48 seconds he's gone down on time as compared to Magnus he's also burned his time and now maybe a good idea is to play queen bees I mean D4 and queen B6 he plays Rook d8 smart move which he is getting his Rook to defend these pawns he is not committing to the D4 move Rook F to E1 play now this with this move on E1 Magnus is putting latent pressure down to the E6 pawn queen A6 interesting move what Magnus wants to do is uh what she wants to do is put pressure on the A2 Pawn but Magnus kicks the Knight away you have to go back to F6 because the D5 Pawn was hanging and now there are a few options you can take on D5 here Queenie 2 rookie 2 ed5 and play this position or you can go for the move B3 which kind of cements this entire structure so Magnus taking his time here this is an important moment pushing the pawn to B3 has its upsides but the downside is that the queen can move out and then A5 A4 and then a weakness will be created either you have to take then the pawns get completely mangled or you don't take and then black takes and the B3 Pawn becomes a weakness so in that sense even a little Pawn push can have some important consequences that's the reason why Magnus is thinking for this time wish he looks confident he's seeing at the giant board there to see other games that are going on and this is what you learn from Magnus that at critical moments he's ready to invest a lot of time look at him he's thought for nearly a minute now in this critical position because he's trying to assess this end game how is this end game looking for him not so pretty that's the reason why he goes B3 and he asks Anand what's your plan now because if you don't do anything I might even go G4 and start my play on the king side that's what Magnus wants to do which he now defends this Pawn on C5 it is a small Edge for white but how to continue is not so clear Rook C1 played and with this move you want to keep the eye option open of taking on D5 and pressurizing C5 which he bites the bullet he pushes the pawn to D4 as we know this is not the best because now the Knight sits here on D3 E6 is weak C5 Under Pressure Rook goes to D6 and what a classy move by Magnus defending A2 ready to double here Knight D7 also which he plays this quickly defends the pawn and also the E5 Square Magnus brings his Queen to G2 his point is Rook will come to E2 put pressure here I'm going to open up the king side with G4 and Anand starts his Queen side counter play with A5 A4 you know this is Clash of ideas between two classy chess players rookie 2 putting pressure on E6 but there is it's well defended and wishing she starts this queen side counter play you can see Magnus is visibly tensed about it because he sees that even if he goes G4 A4 is coming faster at his Queen side what should he do with A4 he doesn't want to take C4 would get weak if it doesn't take then the B3 Pawn Falls then the C4 is weak so he goes Rook B2 but that's like you know in some ways Magnus is being very careful there but at the same time when your Rook was beautifully attacking the E6 Pawn you don't want to go to B2 and defend the B3 Pawn but that's what the situation demanded and that's what Magnus has done he brings his Queen back he's on the defensive Wishy is doing well now Queen goes back to D1 and what is anan's plan does he want to double the Rooks up or not he goes at six I wish he sees that there was time to improve his position and so he played at six now Queen goes to B6 A4 is coming up guys A4 is on the cards Magnus goes H4 just improving his position as well but it's time to break on the other side one minute five seconds for Magnus Carlson 143 for vishyanand A4 the queen side is now Under Pressure what should Magnus do this is really a very very tense moment you can see where she's confident and he also has almost a minute extra on the clock is this going down which is Lynn is he going to beat Magnus Carlsen Magnus goes Rook B2 it's sort of a defensive move but a good move because B3 would be defended takes on B3 takes back now B3 is a weakness also the a file is open so which she takes control of the a file he says now I have this under control King moves to H2 but the Rook is going to swing over to A6 ready to enter on A2 or even A1 if permitted Queen E2 played which Magnus is like you can't move your Rook my friend now the E6 spawn under pressure and so when she goes to B6 and now G4 Magnus wants to create his own counter play takes on G4 FG this King on H2 can become a weakness and that's what she does he puts pressure here and G5 played takes takes and notice anand's next move the speed at which he sacrifices upon it's a bad decision but it's a complex one his point is if you take your I'm going to put a lot of pressure on this and then win this Pawn back and your King on H2 is not so happy it's exposed so it's a very good Blitz decision by vishyan and Magnus is confused he has 30 seconds left what does he do he does he take the pawn he takes it after some confusion he takes the pawn an idea here could be to take on B3 that is what she wanted to do but after takes takes Queen H5 it can get risky on the king that's the reason why he puts his Rook on E6 maybe it was not intended this but now he has to change plans Queen what a brilliant move it was the only move because you want to bring your queen to D5 and pin The Rook that's exactly what Magnus does now you don't want to move your king here because the room Rook could at some point swing and give a check so what is to be done this is not at all an easy position Knight B6 played one wins the pawn which he could have traded and taken on C E5 but he instead moves his Queen and now Magnus can go Rook G2 white is completely winning white is totally winning here Rook f8 played but the position is still very very complex in the sense that the white king is open what does Magnus play here he must go rookie 4 but he makes a mistake Rook F5 is a strong move for Anand but he plays Rook F3 now C5 push but he goes Knights he fights a blunder Rook get six is the move guys King H2 if you take the by the way take there's a check here and The Rook is hanging but which he does not move his Rook there he goes to G6 E6 take the pawn which he take the pawn on G5 you're completely winning no he gives a check he gives a check King G1 and now with Rook G5 he wants to Magnus to take and Rook G3 and draw the game it's a Perpetual but what a move by Magnus Carlsen look at this move now with this takes the rookie Rook is hanging the queen is hanging and the Knight controls the G3 square if you take this queen then this is hanging with the E Pawn coming down all of a sudden with This brilliant brilliant move 94 the game is over completely this is attack this is attack this is attacked oh my God what a move by Magnus which he has 37 seconds to figure out what to do but he is left clueless here because there's absolutely no move he resigns the game and you can see from Magnus Carlson that was a tough fight he has dodged the bullet there what a game between two world champions it was a pure delight as viewers there was this little moment worth pointing out especially because the tactic was so unusual Magnus played his Knight to C5 attacking here and Wishy moved his Rook to G6 which ended in a lost position for him here which he had a very powerful mood who Cat6 King G1 if played we have to see that but if you take here this is lost you lose E1 and your game is over so you play a king to G1 here and this is where the brilliant move comes you may want to think about it what should black play the move is D3 and the idea is to clear the D4 Square for the queen if you take I come here with a check and after King H2 we reach the same position hitting the Rook this was not a tall and easy variation but would have given vishi a clear advantage foreign"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

by Maxine and Magnus has a sip of water removes his suit puts it behind his chair and of course he's going to adjust all his pieces he first turns his Knights towards the inside adjusts his pawns plays Knight F6 but doesn't press the clock and takes 20 seconds to make his first move but now he's very quick if the Queen's Gambit declined and the semi-slow on the board Bishop G5 leads to very sharp lines but Magnus goes for the Cambridge Springs variation look at this queen very sneakily it is not just pinning but also eyeing the bishop Bishop B4 you can take on C4 to attack here but for now the line that is being played is somewhat not the main line but is played quite often 94 attacking the bishop now you can take on e4 but it has to be calculated carefully because look after you take Pawn takes the queen attacks the bishop you have to save it so Maxim takes it Magnus takes it back and saves his Bishop to H4 what is magnus's plan because this looks bad oh it snatches the pawn you can't take it because Knight takes A2 there's a pin here Queen C2 played defending the pawn and now the problem here is If you defend your E4 Pawn with F5 I'm simply going Bishop E2 and after castles which is a big blunder in comes Bishop B7 and if you take you lose the queen so these are all the traps in the position Magnus would do well not to cling on to this Pawn in fact if he just moves this queen back that would be much better but F5 looks so tempting to keep your extra Pawn however the lead in development would be a bit too much also the bishop on C8 is not developed the Rook on 8 is also outside the game so Magnus must sort of not get greedy here and just simply bring his Queen back he's taking his time you can see he's down to one minute 54 seconds he brings his Queen back Maxim has two minutes 40 seconds he takes the pawn on e4 that's a very healthy pawn and now white is definitely better out of the opening because he can also develop his Bishop then castle and if you play a move like short castling here then already Bishop E2 and you can sense that the bishop on C8 is unhappy how does Magnus the greatest player right now on the planet and the strongest one in the tournaments always problems well he goes Queen F5 and he tells Maxim can we exchange the Queens can we trade Queens but look if you trade after EF5 your Pawn structure is mangled white spawns are beautiful you won the A2 Pawn which is kind of a Side Pawn Maxim takes he takes a fine on the structure is terrible Bishop comes out to D3 attacking the pawn and Magnus goes Knight B6 now magnus's aim is to attack C4 with Bishop P6 and put pressure here it is quite a decent way to play you can go King E2 and when Bishop E6 is played you can play a pawn to B3 but Maxine castles which is also a very fine move he castles and now Magnus must attack this Pawn on C4 if we place Bishop E6 that would be fine yes he does it now I think a great move here is either B3 or C5 if you attack the Knight on C5 now if you play here this is a terrible move because you can't take with the bishop F5 Pawn is hanging so you have to take back with the pawn and now this is a terrible structure why it is clearly better so what you want to do is you want to take your Pawn takes but then if you play Knight D5 there is C4 and if you play Knight C4 there's Rook A1 with the other Rook moving in and then two Rooks playing here just like Bangkok Gambit but without having to sacrifice the pawn so a very good move is C5 but you can sense that Maxim is tempted to play D5 and he plays it he plays D5 and his point here is that your king is still in the center my Bishop is your Magna sticks on C3 very important move because if you had taken directly the Knight would have taken on D5 now D Bishop B2 the speed at which Magnus is making his moves is superb now Rook is attacking the bishop you need to move it where if you go back here it would lead to Triple pawns and also C5 would be on cards so Bishop A3 is the correct move because you're stopping C5 also your Bishop can go back at the right time Bishop F5 Maxim takes this pawn and now Bishop C5 would be a normal natural move just bringing back the bishop solidifying the position Magnus goes G6 a very dangerous move because while he's attacking the bishop he's also weakening the dark squares in his position at some point the bishop could come to F6 with one minute 12 seconds on the clock what is Maxine going to do he goes Bishop H3 he plays his Bishop back and now Magnus must decide how to continue playing F5 would be a bit too silly because E4 opens it up and this Pawn is very strong so he takes the pawn bishop takes E6 and Bishop C5 now look at the Tactical alertness if you take there's no time for C5 because the bishop is hanging so he goes back and Knight A4 what a move because if you take your knight C5 is a fourth generally such move wouldn't even cross your mind because B7 is hanging Bishop E5 played brilliant muruk f8 and now Maxim must not get tempted by bg7 bd4 is an excellent move stopping Knight C5 no he plays Bishop E5 and Magnus sacrifices in exchange this is a great sacrifice because now even though the material as for the pawns is equal and black is an exchange down the a pawn is too strong F4 A4 look at magnus's Ninth year cannot be moved the a pawn pushing down the bishop ready to control the cleaning square and while white is trying to create his play on the king side it seems a bit too slow what brilliant assessment by Magnus Carlsen this is absolutely genius but now the Rook comes in and says I'm going to blockade on A2 what is your plan Magnus because even if you play Bishop G7 I have F6 but Magnus goes Knight E4 first controlling the F6 square and also at some point can jump into C3 FG HG the pawns are traded 45 seconds for Magnus Carlsen 34 for Maxima he goes Bishop E6 but now Magnus attacks The Rook he hits it here Now The Rook If It Moves away then A2 A1 is incoming so you have to come up rook A2 but now the Knight can jump into C3 he does it he attacks the roof The Rook has to move oh my God but you know there's one hope for maxim if he plays C5 his Bishop can go back and stop the pawn he goes Rook C2 Magnus is going to push the pawn Rook a one player and now look at this if you go 90 to check rookie two Bishop a one there's C5 attacking here so he goes King E7 what a brilliant move the bishop can no longer remain on this diagonal it has to move and then he plays this Magnus finds this move literally in couple of seconds now 92 that is Ultimate chess now Bishop A1 there's no way you can stop the bishop coming out and pawn queening amazing Chess By Magnus Carlsen"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

we are about to begin it's five minutes plus three seconds increment per move and pragnananda and karyakin have had this race sort of karyakin became the youngest Grandmaster in the world at the age of 12 years and seven months and pragnananda was trying desperately to beat that record in the end he missed it by a couple of months but here they are fighting against each other and this is going to be very very interesting Prague in this tournament hasn't won a single game yet this is round number five he is on half a point out of four he plays the Karo Khan D5 karyakin takes the pawn C takes D5 and plays a very simple line just to keep it simple against Prague no Theory takes a bit of his time to figure out what exactly he wants to play does he want to develop his Knight here the Knight here the bishop coming out he decides to play his night out to C6 this is a very standard position and C4 would lead us to the pano-botwinic attack but karyakin goes completely in a different direction he goes Bishop B5 and pins the Knight now main Museum E6 Bishop G4 but Prague goes A6 it's like he's telling Sergey I don't really believe in your move what are you going to do karyakin simply chops off the night B Tech C6 and now Prague has the bishop pair but look at White's development his Knight is out he's going to Castle very quickly he's going to hit the center actually he goes Knight E5 first he's hitting the spawn and now notice what should Prague do there are defensive moves like bd7 Queen C7 but a very active move is Bishop F5 because if you take I go Queen C7 and then you move your knight I take your pawn and this is very good position for black so Prague should baby Play Bishop F5 Bishop D7 is too passive but he plays it and you can see immediately the bar moves in kariakin's favor white is clearly better now just because prague's Bishop is too passive and against the super GM like Sergey this is not going to be easy for Prague Pawn up to C4 very strong move by karyakin putting pressure in the center if truck ever takes on C4 look at his pawns all isolated and weak truck develops his Knight out to F6 and karyakin also brings his Knight in there's a lot of pressure here and notice if you play E6 then after C5 you are positionally busted as black so Prague takes his time and he's like I don't want to play E6 because C5 is very strong but what are my options how do I develop this bishop if I play G6 it looks a tad slow maybe then the only option real options feels like taking on C4 and yes your structure is then ruined which Prague does he takes but on the other hand he gets a free-flowing position and also you know his Bishops can then at least feel that the position is open karyakin says this is my Pawn I'll take it whenever needed and he castles it out which is a good move he understands the position very well and pragna Nanda goes E6 now a best case scenario for Prague would be to play the move C5 so for example if white were to take here then maybe C5 is something that you should think of although D5 is possible there so C5 is something that Prague should be aiming for and karyakin would be looking to stop it and one of there are many ways you can stop it and one of them is Queen F3 that karyakin plays because now if you go C5 then already D takes C5 Bishop takes C5 and now Knight comes out to E4 you can't take the Knight there's a mate here and I'm already looking at these weaknesses Rook coming to D1 that is terrible position so Prague goes Rook to C8 and which is logical he defends the pawn on C6 and once again keeps an eye out that if I get an option to play C5 I will play it this is quite a positional battle going on between karyakin and Prague Prague looking at the demo boards there the big screen where all the games are being broadcasted he would be looking for his first win in the Super tournament this is his first ever super tournament and he has been having a tough time there will he be able to fight back is the question now what is Sergey thinking one idea is Rook D1 he goes Bishop G5 which is again a beautiful move he's pinning the Knight here maybe he wants to bring his other Rook to D1 then his other Rook to E1 product breaks the pin with Bishop E7 logical chess but now Rook comes to D1 Rook E1 and white would have complete domination over the position karyakin taking his time he knows that this position is really good but what is the best way to grind it Rook D1 plate which is a fine move here and now it's clear that truck cannot easily play C5 because it opens up this file against the bishop and the Queen so short Castle played here by black and now actually take this Pawn C5 could be possible when D5 but this is exactly the kind of position that Prague wants you know can it really complex and then after takes your Bishop takes or a queen takes maybe this is already fine for black you know the position has improved considerably so in order to stop this karyakin is thinking and he finds this nice little Moon Knight A4 you can see that he's controlling the C5 Square no longer can play this move Pawn up to C5 and now for Prague it's again decision time maybe a good idea here is to drop your Bishop back to E8 but then the Knight jumps to C5 and already it feels so scary because the night is so well placed and if you take I take with the pawn attacking the queen and when the queen comes up then the Knight goes G4 and there is a pin here and it is big big trouble there for Prague so Bishop dropping back to E8 while seems logical because there's a constant pressure by this Knight on the bishop it's still not solving everything so Prague can go for something where he's trying to exchange a few pieces one idea that comes to mind is Knight to D5 when the Bishops can be traded but for now he's taking his time here he is down to two minutes five seconds prak should be careful first of all his position is bad but if he falls under Big Time trouble then it would be almost impossible to salvage against a player of karyakin's caliber but one can completely understand the confusion that the kid is going through because his position is really really not so great and Prague has taken a lot of time he goes Knight D5 he tells Sergey would you like to trade the Bishops which he does Queen takes and now the Knight jumps into C5 now there are two attacks on this bishop so Bishop goes back and karyakin now takes the pawn on C4 this Pawn is weak a6c6 both pawns are weak Knights are beautiful Bishop is not doing much what is Prague going to do is already one minute down on time karyakin is simply crushing this position well time for first to improve this bishop says Prague I'm going to play F6 someday I hope my Bishop will pop out from here and look at this beautiful diagonal although now Knight takes A6 is actually a bad move because Rook 8 and black gets counter play against the A2 Pawn this is one thing that white doesn't want to be happening in the position which is to let black get counter play you know one plan is E5 because if you take D takes E5 the C5 Knight is hanging so once again karyakin's play will revolve around stopping this plan and you can see he goes Queen A3 because now if truck goes here he can simply chop off the pawn which is actually very good for him and should be no problem so the Knight is defended in full prophylaxis mode here pragnananda down to one minute 10 seconds he goes Bishop to F7 makes sense here he defends his spawn on E6 karyakin puts further pressure down on the E6 spawn maybe Prague should go Rook FDA because still none of the pieces can actually take on A6 if you take with the Knight then already I can exchange the Queens here and then Rook comes to A8 and that would be great so Prague can go Rook fd8 without any trouble but he goes through K8 this is slightly passive but Prague is essentially saying to Sergey what is your plan on Improvement because now if you take on A6 You're simply blundering a piece I'll take here which is just lost so you can't do that but if you can't play that where is your plan to improve maybe Knight A5 putting pressure on C6 makes a lot of sense there and that is something that you may want to consider here uh the other options actually include oh he goes H3 and this is karyakin's way of saying to Prague I am just trying to keep the position as it is and put pressure on you because you are down to 50 seconds but I liked how truck quickly made his last move rookie telling kariakin that I also have a lot of waiting moves up my sleeve is thinking where to go next Queen A4 interesting move he wants to attack the C6 pawn and Prague now defends it with his Queen on C7 karyakin offers a trade of Queens because now with the trade this would be clearly better end game for for kariakin but Prague is not going to trade the Queens is down to 40 seconds Queen beard I love this move because now he's planning to come to B5 and if you ever take the queen cb5 would improve my structure and also hit the Knight so this is very tricky play by Prague very good move Queen to be it karyakin plays his Rook to C1 defending the Knight on C4 and I think it's time for truck to play his move Queen to B5 which he plays and now of course you never want to trade karyakin instantly goes back with his Queen but the position now look 96 is a big threat there is a fourth year Supra covers it he covers the square root d8 and you can sense that there's some confidence in his body language he can sense that his pieces are more coordinate at night E4 played you're now trying to Fork once again on D6 the queen and the Rook pragnananda has to decide he's down to 24 seconds Prague you need to make a move Queen before I love this move very tricky if you take I take A2 is hit D4 is hit D3 there is a fork too many problems and I think this is where karyakin needs to decide he can play rookie D1 defending the queen and also defending the D3 Square later on but he mustn't take the queen and if he does not take it then he must find Rook D1 but he's thinking and look at his time he's down to 43 seconds pragnananda has 25 seconds and kariakin needs to make a move you know one of the most difficult things in chess is when you've been dominating the entire game and suddenly your advantage is slipping away it's very difficult to reconcile yourself that now the position is no longer as great as it used to be and there you can see karyakin down to 20 seconds he's taking a lot of pressure and maybe this will give Prague the chance he was looking for he goes Knight C5 back and in fact Prague can now repeat with Queen B5 although karyakin would not repeat the position but he plays A5 and he tells Sergey that I'm actually happy with my position I'm ready to continue the game which is quite sensible A3 played and now bro can actually chop off the queen and then move his Knight yes he does he takes Knight takes and now night F4 brilliant now this is attacked and also there are threats of E5 because then this is hanging so G3 is an important move here but he goes rookie four this is not a great move E5 should be played by Prague but he finds a tactic Rook takes and there's a four coming in he takes on D4 fantastic Chess By Prague he's a pawn up but still the black pawns are slightly weak so it's not like complete advantage to Prague he is a pawn up but white has great compensation I like his next move E5 activating his Bishop here karyakin recovers this Pawn but look at the black pieces now they look so good in the center Prague now starts pushing his Central majority karyakin is angling to push his Queen Side Pawn this is still a massive massive race here E4 push 93 would be excellent because then you can take the bishop but instead he goes A4 and now pragnananda pushes his Pawn even further Knight B6 needs to be found by karyakin but he actually plays Rook to C3 and now can find rupiah he finds it the best move in the position karyakin must find Knight A6 Rook 8 and then it would be a repetition but he goes A5 blunders the pawn and now this position is totally lost for white because drugs Rook is now active his pieces are active he attacks the night King comes in Pawn up and now you can see there after Rook takes a fork and pragnananda has one material which is amazing and he plays another accurate move hitting the Knight and the pawn simply amazing chest there by Prague karyakin was unable to handle the time pressure and you can see there he is completely losing now not only is he an exchange down he's also a pawn down and Prague is very confident here you can Bank on Prague not to fall into some night Forks here Prague plays a spawn up to H6 upon G5 but in in Blitz chess you can never be sure you know if you are careless one night fork and the game is over but one good rule of thumb is that you can place your pieces on opposite color square like if the king is on a light Square you can put your Rook on a dark square and they can never be by the way a discovered attack coming in he plays his Rook down King up and then the Rook comes here putting pressure on this Pawn he pushes forward but now this Pawn is going to be lost pretty soon Prague has 12 seconds karyakina 16 would this be the first ever win for pragnananda in the super tournament that would be huge King G5 Knight comes back to D3 attacking the rook and now the Rook moves back to E8 night before and Prague places Bishop to E4 saying I won't even give you that pawn and now he chops up the pawn on G6 he's two pawns up completely in control King comes up to G5 you can see how confidently the youngster is playing and of course he's just a grand master at this point but already you can see the Sparks of someone who is very very special Bishop goes back gives a check to the king with the Rook King comes down and it's time to push the G5 G Pawn down the port G5 now the Knight attacks The Rook Rook comes in attacking the Knight and now Knight goes back to C2 maybe you push the pawn even further the Knight is attacking The Rook and now the Rook attacks the Knight this is nice geometry there at night D4 played Prague simply brings his King back no checks should be able to disturb him there and pawn to G3 next stop Rook coming in and karyakin resigns pregnant and the sports his first win of the tournament what a game he was worse out of the opening but he kept his calm and scored a win amazing battle"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

his time for the first move and then decides that he wants to play D5 C4 we have the Queen's Gambit and Slough on the board Knight F6 E3 played and Magnus goes for the semi-slav Hikaru brings his Knight to D2 generally you put your knight on C3 in such positions but Knight D2 has made Magnus think for a bit because it's not the main move although there are more than 4000 games in this position as well Magnus goes for B6 he wants to develop the problem Bishop for black because all his pawns are on light squares this bishop is passive he wants to get it out on B7 Hikaru plays his Bishop out Bishop to B7 by Magnus and I think it's time to Castle it loud for Hikaru so while Hikaru has gone for a very steady setup Magnus is still two moves away from getting his king castle and that's the reason why Hikaru opens up the position makes complete sense and in fact this is a very nice position for white out of the opening Magnus takes the pawn Knight takes on e4 and now the pieces are well positioned this bishop can actually move out the bishop on D3 is angling on this diagonal and also you have good Center control at some point point you can also play B3 and Bishop B2 and that's the reason why Magnus here is being careful that he doesn't land up in a very inferior position he takes the Knight Bishop takes and now generally if black can get a successful C5 in this position he would be doing pretty well however right now the bishop is hanging so you cannot play the pawn up to C5 it makes sense to actually kick the bishop here but then the bishop would simply go back to the C2 square and that's the reason why Magnus goes Bishop D6 he keeps his Knight on the D7 Square develops his Bishop preparing short castling also can get the queen out an angle towards hikaru's King side Hikaru Nakamura plays his Queen up to E2 the queen is well positioned here looking at the king also defending the bishop just in case and if you Castle now of course there are some tactics that you have to look at with Bishop takes at seven but they are not working Knight G5 could also be an idea so Magnus can Castle but look at his time he's already one minute down as compared to Hikaru plays his Queen up to C7 and now this bishop and queen battery is looking in that direction although the pawn is comfortably defended by the knight at some point Hikaru has to decide how to meet it because magnus's main idea is to play C5 here if if he gets that he would be doing pretty fine and this bishop and queen battery is also pretty strong so very good idea here is put the bishop on G5 bring it to H4 and then to G3 it's not an easy idea to think about but it is very interesting other plants can include going A3 followed by B4 gaining space but you are not really stopping the C5 move as such and that's the reason why Hikaru has taken a good solid minute here to figure out what he should be doing and he plays his Bishop to G5 excellent move Magnus pushes the bishop away the bishop goes to H4 and now he castles it out so very stable play by both sides now C5 is really on the cards at some point although when you play your Pawn up to C5 you do have to look at D5 options for white getting a past Pawn and right now Hikaru has gone 10 seconds below magnus's time but he still has 3 minutes 20 seconds it's a question of where do you want to put your Rooks C1 D1 he goes Rook a D1 and that means his other Rook will most likely go to E1 Square now can mag can Magnus push his Pawn to C5 the problem is after I take take and now I take here the bishop is hanging and if you take back with the bishop I play my Rook up I'm trying to double down here also my Bishop is well placed the Rook can swing over so suddenly the position can get very nasty in this so Magnus has to be careful the move that he wants might not be the best so he goes rookie 8 very smart move and the point is Now The Rook is standing opposite the White Queen Hikaru quickly places Bishop to G3 that is a very logical move by Hikaru and Magnus chops it off and Hikaru was instantly going to take H takes G3 because you know when you capture towards the center it's always very logical but now he takes his time he's like hmm if I take with the F Pawn my Rook will open up here and also notice that Magnus has moved his Rook away from my fate so perhaps the F7 point is slightly soft can I take it and that's the reason why Hikaru is actually considering to take with his F Pawn that would be a very unconventional decision and he takes it amazing but now Magnus is doing pretty well okay if you are Magnus in this position what would you do think about it one idea clearly which really is calling itself out is to play C5 because then after Bishop B7 Queen B7 there's no Bishop also hanging on B6 I really like this smooth C5 okay if you don't want to activate your Bishop what else would you do of course the E5 E5 looks also a phenomenal move and black is doing fine the other option can also be F5 because then the bishop has to go back and next move you open this up with C5 so there are so many attractive options for Magnus Carlsen then I guess he's a bit confused there he definitely understands that his position is good but look at his time he's down to two minutes 15 seconds generally Magnus does not think so much he sees a good move he makes it but here somehow he is not very sure in which way to continue C5 E5 and you can see there he wanted to push his Pawn but now he just waited in his tracks there's something about this position he does not like is it that C5 is met with D5 it can't be it just opens up the Rook to the queen that's a terrible move well then why not C5 Magnus no he goes through kd8 and this actually gives Hikaru some attacking possibilities you know how he can go G4 and his idea is next move to go G5 imagine you make a waiting move I simply push night jumps him Rook is here Bishop is here Queen is here it would be insane attack will Hikaru push his Pawn forward with G4 and G5 that would be a very big attacking possibility for him also he can go B4 because that move simply stops in some way the move C5 but Hikaru also taking his time both players are actually finding this position slightly tricky to move forward and that's the reason why they are taking quite a bit of time Hikaru down to two minutes and now Magnus has one minute 40c 46 seconds what is Hikaru thinking because this Rook is well placed is he thinking about moving his Knight to E5 could be possible could be possible to play Knight E5 but that also doesn't seem right somehow you know you go with your knight here I simply take take I exchange the Rooks it doesn't look great you're you're exchanging pieces white has many weaknesses well Hikaru down to one minute 30 seconds he needs to make a move oh my God he sacrificed a pawn he's gone C5 and he tells Magnus your Bishop is really bad but Magnus says I don't care and instantly goes G4 oh now I get the idea the idea was to shut down this bishop so that he cannot exchange it keep your Bishop on this Square for a few moves and go G4 G5 wow that was the idea of Hikaru Nakamura although the engine seemed to hate it I think with just one minute 20 seconds it's a perfect decision now Magnus has a great defense you take the pawn and when he pushes here oh he took it he took it and Hikaru pushes forward now Magnus must find Knight C5 because that prepares Bishop A6 it's not an easy move because you take your Bishop A6 black is actually really better here no but to play Knight C5 requires nerves of Steel because you are weakening your king size and Magnus is down to 57 seconds Hikaru has actually chosen this attack very smartly objectively he's busted here but with the clock ticking down it's not going to be easy for Magnus to find all the defensive moves Knight C5 is the best move but after that the next best is C5 and Magnus plays it he's offering the Bishops to be traded Hikaru takes the king Side Pawn Magnus takes it back now look at this King it's completely exposed if only the queen can jump in here the Rook is looking the Knight has to move away somewhere but how do you do the other Rook can also swing over this way he goes Knight D2 very interesting move because now the queen is coming up The Rook is looking here but black has a very powerful move F5 can Magnus find it yes he finds it he's completely winning this game and Hikaru Nakamura in big trouble now if you were to take your queen takes and move in with your queen a simple move is Knight F6 bringing your queen in here but Hikaru goes directly Queen H5 and he's telling Magnus that if you take this piece then after Queen G6 it's a draw it's a draw in the position so Magnus goes Knight f8 opening up his Queen to this that to this rank what is Hikaru going to play now he takes on B7 Magnus takes it back Magnus has currently two extra Pawns in the position and if he gets his Queen here it would be so it would be game over but look at Hikaru he's swinging his Rook over here Magnus has to find rookie seven which is the best defense but he goes King at seven and now can Hikaru find this killer blow Knight E4 the point is if you take with the pawn that is look up sell and finds it what a move by Hikaru Nakamura you can't take here because this is Checkmate King a cheat Rook G3 it's a Checkmate here and if you were to take with the pawn Rook F7 is game over what a move Hikaru finds an amazing move Magnus goes rookie seven he's clearly in trouble with 13 seconds left now Hikaru has many many options he can swing his Rook over here he can go Knight G5 check maybe even Knight F6 check is in the air there are many options what does he do look at Hikaru he's just trying to figure out if there's a killing shot there Knight G5 check King comes to G7 brings his Rook forward whoa this is looking like a clear mating attack but Hikaru can't find the mate he's trying his best should he take with the queen should he take with the Rook what she what should he do because Rook takes King F6 in fact the black king is running away if you even give this check the king can come up right out in the boat no he takes with the queen king F7 check King up check and you can see Hikaru he can't find more than a draw he's shaking his head he's like no there should be more here there should be a mating attack maybe Rook G8 somehow Rook G7 check no he gives a check Magnus brings this King up the position is in fact a draw gives a check and agrees to a draw whoa yeah comes in and says why didn't you go Rook G8 and Magnus shows maybe there is E5 because if you give a check my king can come up and so maybe that position is just a draw what a fight between these two legendary players it was an epic fight that ended in a draw amazing chess"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

but Magnus removes his jacket adjusts his chair also puts all the pieces on the right place before he begins this is magnus's way of getting into the Zone he plays one C4 the English opening Duo is slightly surprised ghost Knight F6 Magnus brings out his Knight we have the symmetrical English Pawn up to G3 E6 played now Knight comes out and dubo plays in the center tubo is known for his tarash defense in fact many have started calling it Dubose tarash it involves taking this Pawn getting the bishop out and Magnus is well prepared because he knows that dubo has played this before Knight comes out black castles look at the speed with which dubo is playing he has three minutes 11 seconds he started with three minutes plays rookie eight also Theory Magnus now taking it his time because he's recollecting what he should do the main move here is rookie one he remembers it he plays it and now the best move is to play H6 the spawn in the center is weak it may fall but black is banking on peace activity so pushing away the bishop asking it a question is a good idea you can see Daniel dubo taking his time he's not thinking he's actually recollecting his analysis because you can see him looking not on the chessboard but in the distance he plays at six Magnus now first chops up the bishop you had to take it back because the Rook was hanging now once again The Rook is attacked so Pawn takes Bishop now takes the Knight Mass exchanges Queen takes pawn and dubo goes back if you take here The Rook takes the Rook is active here the bishop is coming out it is compensation so once again Magnus plays the best move and queen C3 dubo pushes his Pawn Rook comes in and attacks the queen now the queen has to move away but again do both taking a bit of his time plays Queen E7 excellent chess this Pawn is hanging so the Knight comes back and defends and look at that move then he'll do more with just 15 seconds taken is pushing his Pawn here wants to open it up the bishop will come on the wrong diagonal this is actually looking quite great compensation for black black has Five Pawns against white six pawns also time wise Magnus is 30 seconds down on time Magnus plays a spawn up to A3 saying to Dupo that I'm a pawn up dubo says I don't care I'm coming at your king now Magnus under big pressure because imagine that if this Pawn takes the H file opens up then the queen could enter here and that is problem also The Rook can swing over this side this is just tremendous but Magnus has to keep his calm he has to figure out what are the ways in which he can activate his pieces his extra Pawn is not making itself felt right now now the Knight comes out to D3 a normal move here is to put the bishop on this long diagonal that seems very logical but Dupo comes Rook A4 with the Rook lift and Magnus drinks water here look at him he has one minute less but I think he's calming himself down he's saying to himself there is pressure but let's be cool let's not overreact The Rook is very well placed it in fact stops the Knight coming to F4 oh but Magnus plays it Magnus plays his Knight to F4 and dubo is thinking can I just sacrifice The Rook for the night can he do that but actually after takes here the queen opens up on the third Rank and it's not a good sacrifice so right now it's not time enough to take it but you can first develop your Bishop I think that would make a lot of sense Dupont now starting to take time which is very logical he puts his Bishop on the long diagonal Magnus must be careful a move which is not played with great thought can lead him into trouble a very good move now is Rook D3 because with this move the Rook comes to the third rank it can also switch here and also at some point can come to E3 to exchange off a few pieces so it's a tough move to make but Magnus has to find it he has one minute on the clock he needs to speed up a bit 50 seconds left for him and that too Under Pressure can Magnus Carlsen actually find the best move he's thinking and he plays it you can Bank on Magnus to find the best moves in the position and now look at this you can take and perhaps sack here because now look if you take then I come in with my queen threatening a mate in one now you must block with the Rook if you block with the pawn then I can take the pawn here so Rook comes here and now you bring your other Rook into the attack so Daniel Dupo is actually calculating these lines and here's a very nice variation because if you play something like Queen D3 then Rook comes here you take take you can't move the Rook because it's a mate so all of these variations being calculated by Daniel dubo and actually it starts with taking here and then taking on F4 ripping apart the white King's position but dubo plays Rook E4 and he's telling Magnus then maybe I want to put some pressure over here Magnus pushes The Rook oh he takes the opponents the blunder look at Magnus he's like what's happening why can't I just take the Rook isn't this a big blunder there Magnus just making sure that he's not blundering something he takes Pawn takes now if you move your king here Queen E4 is actually lost position so he takes the pawn check and now dubo I think I miss this Knight Retreat you can see him stopping in his tracks because he thought he could win the night but after Knight H3 Magnus is a complete Rook up a position where dubo had such great chances has suddenly ended up in a completely lost position for him he has blundered big time an entire rook and Magnus not going to let this go there was a mate threat over there on G7 so the pawn comes up and now magnets can simply move his Queen here a check and that's what he does he gives a check King comes up and he can move in he can move in here to threaten a mate in one Dupont knows that the writing is on the wall the queen comes in Magnus still has 10 seconds left the only problem could be time but I think it's enough for Magnus to convert this because it's a double attack you're threatening a mate here and you're also attacking the bishop dubo doesn't really have too many options from a position that was filled with Rich possibilities dubo just blundered and Magnus takes another piece and resignation with a smile after all they are good friends of each other and there Magnus is saying you could have taken my knight with the rook and so they are analyzing this position which was so rich I mean if dubo would not have blundered here by taking on G3 and would have played his Rook to D4 the position was still so so complex he could have done that but there you have it a quick decision dubo was playing fast and perhaps that led to his downfall Magnus Carlson found some amazing moves actually amazing defensive moves I really like the Rook D3 move which put dubo under great pressure and eventually gave the world champion his victory phenomenal defensive effort by Magnus Carlsen foreign"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an

one C4 this is the English opening C5 signals the symmetrical English G3 fiance Towing his Bishop so does yakovenko the Knight comes out we are seeing both players playing symmetrical moves D3 and now yakovanco thinks for a bit there is E6 there is E5 here all these possibilities he goes D6 and this is the secret move Queen D2 the idea is to defend the Knight put the pawn here and place your Bishop on B2 yakovenko still continues copying B3 B6 Bishop B2 and now Bishop goes to B7 and this is where Magnus jumps in with his Knight now if you continue the copying game then the Knight comes to D4 then I push it you push me I go back you go back I push you again you push me I take you you take me takes takes Queen takes Queen takes I take here you take care and finally I give a check so the Symmetry is gone so that's not a good idea and that's the reason why yakovenko is thinking what to do he takes on B2 Queen takes B2 attacking The Rook Pawn comes up to E5 however now look at this Knight it's such a monster here and Magnus instantly tries to open up the position but yakovenko wanted to Long Castle oh that was his idea very interesting Magnus brings his night out now look he's attacking this Pawn here you cannot take it because the Rook is hanging and so F6 makes a lot of sense but that increases the power of this Knight on D5 because now you want to play Knight E7 but the pawn is hanging here so you can't develop the Knight what else can you do you would want to play your Rook to f8 to defend it to prepare here but then after I take you take I jump in here with a tactical Blow The Rook is hanging here on f8 so you take I take you take back I give you a check Knight has to go back and after Queen if I it is curtains this is hanging so there are so many problems here for yakovanco to solve right out of the opening he goes with the other Knight which is very smart Pawn up to E4 instantly played by Magnus look at his time he's just taken 10 seconds on the clock Knight takes night and yakovenko is like at least now my Pawn won't be hanging so I can develop my knight here Magnus takes back and the Knight jumps into E7 and he captures now an important moment you want to take back here so that there's no weakness but the problem is that the Knight jumps here and then wants to settle down on the E6 Square which is a beautiful weakness and even if you come here Knight E6 Rook D E8 Bishop H3 next move I'm going to chop this off and the Knight is going to be very very strong here so that's the reason why yakovenko is thinking he would love to play Pawn takes F takes E5 but he decides to go D takes E5 Magnus instantly plays his Knight I think he's come with an intention to win with couple of minutes on his clock Rook f8 the pawn is defended Knight E4 played again attacking and three telling yakovico if you push it I'll go Knight G5 and settle down on E6 so yakovenko has to go even further passive here by bringing his Knight back but then how does Magnus continue and this is a big instructive lesson when jakobenko plays his night back you must think what should you do here as white and it teaches you the concept of two weaknesses which means that this is already weak how does Magnus open up another front look at that move B4 takes Queen takes and now you can open up the king with A4 A5 or C5 and suddenly you have too many problems to face this is weak this is weak he goes F5 but now that is because the pressure is mounting Knight to G5 played fantastic move Knight is coming into E6 jakobenko says do you want to trade Queens because I know that you are going to attack my king and Magnus says but the end game is also better for me he can actually pick up this Pawn here but instead goes for a centralizing move attacking the pawn on E5 H6 played now look at magnus's time he has two minutes 29 seconds yakovanco is down to 30 seconds rookie won he picks up this spawn Knight F6 so Magnus is a pawn up again moving super quick it's amazing to see how such a strong player like yakovenko is completely decimated by Magnus by not even thinking what I like now about Magnus is this phase where he's totally winning and he can continue blitzing out his moves but in fact he takes his time he'll play Slowly because one of the toughest things to do in chess is to win a winning game check here the bishop comes back now black is completely tied up but what would be your next plan would you push the Knight away because anyway the Knight can't come to E3 The Rook controls it or would you go D4 yes that's what Magnus wants to do he wants to push his Pawn up to C5 to dislodge The Rook here G5 played attacking the Knight and now the Knight can also jump to E6 the bishop can't take it it's pin you can also play Knight to H5 or you can go Knight D3 to E5 there are many possibilities but there you can see Magnus making the first long thing in the game C5 here played he pushes The Rook away and The Rook needs to move Rook D7 and a lot to learn from Magnus here as in chess one of the toughest things to do is convert a winning position into a win and Magnus ensuring that he uses all the time left for that Knight to G6 played the Knight comes back Magnus attacks it and yakovenko picks up the pawn now one of the easiest way to win here is to take Rook takes take the bishop and then Fork here and you are completely winning but Magnus takes his time again finds the best Moon Knight E5 The Rook has nowhere to go and next move I'm going to chop this off and with this Magnus scores a very smooth win in the

finest chess players visit Gujarati and vishianan with it opens the game with Knight F3 which he plays D5 G3 the ready Knight comes out the bishop develops and vishy also starts building a home on the king side with it goes for the symmetrical variation C4 C6 the solid grunfeld one thing that is slightly surprising is with it making his moves with left hand he generally plays with the right hand but somehow it seems like he wants to be a little relaxed in this game now he goes A4 which is very logical because you want to stop the pawn coming to B5 vishy castles it out and now the main move here is to put your knight on A3 so that you can win this Pawn but right now with it goes for Queen C2 he wants to win this ball and you can look at vishi adjusting himself in the chair because he feels that this is not Theory now one of the most normal moves is to play A5 and latch on to the B4 Square get your knight from A6 to B4 but Wishy makes a provocative move he defends the pawn with his Bishop why is this provocative because now with it can jump to G5 with his Knight attack the bishop but he has to be a little bit careful the pawn on D4 is hanging and then he can take your Pawn takes ruin the structure and go Knight D2 attacking here this would be great compensation for with it but he would be two points down and that is exactly what he's thinking over here should he go Knight G5 give up the pawn because if you play Knight G5 and the bishop goes back then the next move you can take the pawn and this seems like a good position for white on the other hand the other options are to develop your knight to A3 and then take the pawn this way with it is taking his time he's down to four minutes which he has 4 minutes 54 seconds the time control is five minutes plus three seconds increment and with it goes for the dangerous move E4 well he doesn't think he needs to recover this Pawn he's expanding in the center but now the D3 square is weak the Knight can jump from A6 to B4 to D3 and it could be very risky here how should vishi respond because with it is clearly not going to take it easy on him he goes at six and he tells you that your chance to get your knight here has passed now Knight A3 again with the idea of Knight C4 seems logical but with it goes Rook D1 and somewhere he's telling vishi I want to push my Pawn to D5 which he unperturbed goes Knight to A6 he is looking at the B4 Square now very important to play Bishop D2 taking control of the B4 square if you go Queen B6 then Bishop C3 Knight B4 then Queen E2 and white is doing excellently well in this position because the C4 Square C4 Pawn will eventually fall so with it must be a little careful of this move Knight to B4 but he jumps on with 95 and that's a big mistake which he can actually now go Knight G4 and the point of this move is that now after you take take the D4 Pawn is hanging can we he's attacking the queen which is also a good move but now with it can go Queen C3 and attack the Knight he does it he plays his Queen to C3 the Knight is attacked how does vishy respond to this now whoa he goes C5 he defends the Knight and tells with it you can't take the pawn your Rook is hanging here so this Pawn is pinned right now C5 now with it must take Knight C4 this is a very important move and then after Knight G4 when the attack is Unleashed here you have to play E5 good or bad this is the only way to remain in the game but why not just push the pawn forward with D5 isn't this a good move well the problem is the spawn is attacking nothing because D6 is impossible The Rook is hanging and if you're not attacking anything with this Pawn then suddenly this pin becomes absolutely dangerous let's see if with it falls for D5 he shouldn't play D5 Knight takes C4 is his only chance he has two minutes 30 seconds oh he pushes T5 that is a bad move but now can we see fine Knight G4 it's the only way to get the advantage anything else and with it will go F4 and just solidify Exposition where she finds it brilliant move because now if you play Pawn up to F4 then after take take Bishop G4 already the position is lost Knight is coming in the E5 Pawn will fall so Knight G4 is a tremendous move by vishian and he has taken note of the fact that the Rook is unprotected and his Bishop is not hanging so for with it it's big trouble time now because his Knight is poorly placed he needs to do something about it and we just saw that F4 would not cut the bill so what should he do he goes Bishop F4 defending the Knight but now another powerful move is to push Pawn to G5 can vision and find this he has four minutes on the clock and he is actually in scintillating form right now maybe he can spot it because after G5 the bishop cannot move E5 would fall the Knight is pin so it cannot move the pawn cannot move because it is pin he goes G5 finds it beautiful chest by vishianan and right now with it under big pressure he goes Bishop to F3 and he tells vishi look now your Bishop is hanging because I've just protected my Rook so now Anand if he's in tremendous form he'll find this unbelievably unbelievably difficult move Bishop C8 why is it difficult because firstly it's a backward move secondly you are not blocking your Queen's path here and I think it's not such an easy move to find it amidst all the calculations that are going on so Anand taking his time rightly so whoa he finds it that's the reason why he's the five-time world champion what a move found by vishianan suddenly with it is still under big pressure but now one thing is good he can actually chop off the Knight which is putting pressure here otherwise he's simply losing material he has to take the Knight on G4 but it's not a happy move you make because the bishop jumps in and attacks The Rook you no longer can take this because the queen is hanging and with it now down to one minute 20 seconds he takes Bishop takes G4 and now vishy chops it off with his own Bishop Pawn comes up to F3 so the position has changed a bit you can go back Bishop H5 which is a fine move and then that would be good but it takes on F4 F takes G4 and now if with it only if he can take here and defend his Knight but which is like take the pawn and I want this Knight to be undefended this is a monstrous pin there how does with it react now he's he goes Knight to A3 and what he's planning to do is he's trying to get the Knight here which he goes Knight D3 brilliant move because now the Knight is hanging and if you take Knight C4 I take here take here and queen C7 and you're losing a piece so that's the reason why with the chops of the night with his Rook Pawn takes on D3 and he's already an exchange down so his position is very bad but his Knight comes to the center and he's hoping that he can win both of these pawns and then hope for some compensation with these Knights it's a far cry but it could be possible now Anand needs to go yeah he plays Princess and fantastic move keeping pressure here the queen cannot move the Rook comes in and I love how quickly she played this move because imagine if he went A6 there was A5 and so he first goes B6 Rook takes and now A6 and he's telling with it I'm kicking away your knight here and then your knight on E5 will fall how quickly did he spot it that was just amazing now she has three minutes with it as 50 seconds he pushes his Pawn forward Pawn takes Pawn Knight takes on D6 now how do you continue Rook Ada definitely possible here but Rook ae8 such a cool move because after you take I just take back with my rook and there's no way to save this Knight you would be a piece down and after Rook ae8 we are waiting for with its move he has 42 seconds which he has three minutes on his clock he's just used two minutes out of his stipulated five minutes what a game by vision and he's played just unbelievable chess here with it of course playing risky opening and could not recover after those few inaccuracies and I think it's time to throw in the towel you can see with it calculating last few things trying to see if there's any way to wriggle out of this mess but I think there is none which he is confident

start the clock and off we go it's 15 minutes plus 10 second increment per move Magnus as always takes his time he puts his player card at just his pieces he wants all of them in order before he begins but he doesn't worry about the time that he's losing there he's down to 14 minutes 47 seconds that was roughly around 25 seconds that he took for his first move opens up with one D4 how is savchenko going to respond to it he goes the symmetrical way with D5 Magnus brings out his Knight to F3 and savchenko Strikes the center with C5 Magnus puts his Pawn on E3 very solid and now Boris takes Here pawn takes and places Knight to C6 in fact you can reach this position from The Exchange variation of Karo Khan so we are now in karokan territory Bishop D5 played by Magnus pinning the Knight here and now the bishop comes and pins the Knight on F3 Magnus hits the center with C4 and Boris this you know gets his night out on F6 develops his peace Magnus also brings his night out putting more pressure in the center if you take your D5 can become quite a nuisance so savchenko goes G6 and now Pawn to H3 the move G6 is not a great move because now Magnus is fighting for an advantage he takes on F3 place the pawn up to A6 takes D5 now suddenly you can't take this Pawn so he takes the bishop he takes here takes takes the bishop then and now Queen takes B5 so the net result of all of these trades is that white is a clear Pawn up but savchenko says that your Pawn is hanging now and if you play D5 I can go Rook to A5 so Magnus goes in and chops off the pawn on B7 now the Knight on C6 is hanging both the players have played the opening and currently savchenko chops off the pawn on D4 Magnus quickly castles because there was a threat of a fork on C2 and so does Boris savchenko White has two connected passers on the queen side but are they strong enough Rook comes to D1 attacking the Knight and also pinning it against the queen Knight E2 is possible because if you take here The Rook is hanging but King F1 is completely fine there so savchenko plays Queen B8 and he's telling Magnus if you take here I'm ready to play this in Benco style compensation with my two Rooks and the bishop so Magnus says I'm not interested in this queen trade and in fact goes Queen E4 keeps the queen and savchenko hits it with F5 for Magnus it's not going to be easy to stabilize this position especially with so much activity here that black has so he brings his Queen back to D3 and now savchenko can actually play his Pawn up to E5 or get his Rook to d8 yes he plays his Pawn to E5 so look at the tragedy here if you push the a pawn then the B3 Square gets weak if you push the B3 Pawn then after E4 this entire diagonal gets weak so for Magnus this is a position where he has to put in a lot of effort to understand how to continue he plays this little move Rook B1 which is very logical because when he pushes his Pawn the Knight will no longer come to B3 and attack The Rook Queen comes into B4 Boris wants to bring his other Rook to B8 perhaps Magnus is thinking about developing his Bishop he puts it on E3 and attacks the Knight maybe at some point he would like to take this Knight off Rook goes to d8 which is also a good move and now Magnus hits the queen and asks it to move away but that does weaken the B3 square and the black queen immediately Parks itself on that square Bishop takes D4 and now if you take with the pawn then the Knight simply goes back here so Rook takes and queen comes to D5 offering a trade of Queens savchenko says I'm okay with the trade but I'm going to bring my Rook into the position so Rook B8 played Magnus does not trade Queens he goes Queen C5 but that actually drops a lot of his Advantage Queen C4 savchenko persists he's like let's trade the Queen's Magnus this time chops it off Rook takes and now the Knight jumps into D5 so the Knight is well placed but now the Rook also swoops in these two Rooks are powerful and Rook D2 but can you play a pawn to E4 he does that and now the bishop opens up completely on this diagonal Magnus plays his Pawn to G3 just hoping to actually stop these pawns from advancing but the position is now equal although King F7 King comes to G2 and now he plays his Rook to D4 well although Magnus is a pawn up his position is by no means winning here Rook D1 is a good move but now at the end he's going to lose his B2 Pawn so savchenko takes Rook takes and now you can just take this Pawn with Bishop takes B2 and it's equal you can also take with the Rook if needed this is also completely fine position because that also seems equal but right now Boris savchenko is decided deciding whether he should take the B2 Pawn with his bishop or The Rook he takes it with the bishop Magnus pushes his spawn the position is round about equal now also look at the time Magnus has one minute 14 seconds savchenko has one minute eight seconds he puts his Rook behind the past Pawn the king comes up to E6 there's a check well you can actually take this and go into this Rook end game by bringing your king this side and putting it on a that should also be fine but I think Boris savvchenko is Keen that his Bishop remains on the board after all it's a great piece but Magnus keeps pushing his pawn it goes to A5 now ball is down to last 20 seconds he goes bd4 that's a smart move because he wants to put his Bishop on A7 where it will block the pawn A6 two squares away from queening H4 plane now these are the little moves that Magnus plays very quickly and from here on you will see why he is considered the greatest ever player in end game phase that we have ever seen the position is equal you know black has this bishop nicely placed here The Rook is also active the king is also good Pawn up to E3 that's a fine move trading more pawns cannot be bad for black but now what does Magnus Carlson do his Knight doesn't have great squares so he first gives a check he first puts sevchenko under some pressure he goes to C6 which is the correct move again gives a check asking questions is important when your opponent is low on time again Boris plays the best move goes King D6 so he's hanging on here Rook C8 now either The Rook can go to 8 or it can go to etch it and put pressure here then the G6 Pawn can also become weak for now savchenko goes back and says I'm going to keep control over the root of my Pawn which is the Pawn on H7 Magnus places King to H3 now what's the logic of this move maybe he wants to push his Pawn to H5 and activate his King this way but right now H5 is met with G5 so we are not really sure what Magnus is achieving by this but savchenko now goes Bishop E3 maybe he feels it's the right time to chop this Knight off Magnus first gives a check again this intermediate checks are so good because if you go King C7 maybe he goes now to h8 or eight it's just a question you know maybe it's nothing spectacular there you have it King C7 played also Knight D5 check is possible but it cannot be played because King takes d8 is hanging however after you move the Rook away which Magnus is intending to do Knight D5 check is definitely a possibility he goes Rook to D3 hits the bishop on E3 and now Bishop chops off the Knight Pawn takes okay engine says this is equal because a pawn is going nowhere the king is controlling it and the black Rook is controlling this Pawn how does Magnus Carlsen make any progress firstly it's Boris savchenko's move he's a bit confused how to continue what is the way in which he should play maybe a good way to play is go rookie fourth try to put pressure here and then shift The Rook there he goes King B6 Rook tries to stop the Pawn King blocks it and now H5 excellent play because if you take here then the king comes up and wants to take this Pawn or even enter here savchenko is a little confused about what is to be done and these are the little questions that Magnus is asking combined with the clock ticking down all of this is not easy rookie for the best move in the position played and you can see Magnus was unhappy with this move being played because now his Pawn is hanging if he brings his King here then black takes and then pushes the pawn and then F4 is weak if he moves his Rook here then he drops the A6 Pawn what is Magnus planning to do he has a minute and 27 seconds so there is some time to think here but the position looks like dead equal now he goes Rook F3 and he tells savchenko take this Pawn you will be a pawn of your only problem is your king is too far away and look at my king it's just entering here this is the power of a king king Beast exception code does the right thing he starts bringing his King in King G5 white also brings his King into the attack he's now threatening to take take King takes and then chop off the pawn on F5 when you would most likely be in a winning Rook end game he goes rookie 6 defending the pawn this is a good idea and now Magnus cuts the black king off look at this technique now the king is one two three four files away from everything that's happening so Rook D6 player waiting and asking Magnus what is the way in which you're going to make progress because if you take here I'm taking back with the pawn Magnus says I'm pushing the pawn to at six so that in future if I can win your H7 Pawn this will be a huge huge passer savchenko has calculated that the king and pawn end game is a draw so he offers a rook trade but now Magnus quickly declines it playing his Rook to E3 maybe he wants to go like this this and this very very interesting Chess By the way just so that you know the Rook trade would not have helped because here this is a draw this is how he would have drawn now Rook C4 played Magnus goes in Rook comes back again you can't trade it because that's a draw as we have seen But Magnus can go in with his King foreign still making the best moves possible King E6 and now you must give this check or Rook C7 these two moves draw everything else is just plain lost if you go Rook D4 which is looking very tempting it's also losing because I'll just take the pawn on it seven no it's a blunder Magnus quickly takes the pawn he knows he's winning Rook catch it what a brilliant move and now guys you will notice that Magnus plays his Pawn to H7 his threat is to give a check and make a queen which is winning for Boris savchenko this is all over it turned around so quickly King B7 so that there's no check but now the king comes in he wants to take this pawn and then move the rook and queen Pawn up to F4 now there are many ways to win one of them is King G7 the other is to take King G6 these are the two ways Magnus takes the pawn generally taking this Pawn is not a good idea because then there's no shelter for the king and the checks start but right now the check is met with King H5 and there are no more checks it's amazing how Magnus Carlsen has turned this around totally important sevchenko is not happy with what he has done he really played well in this game but against Magnus even one mistake can prove fatal he is the god of endgame King H5 beautifully played there and now the Rook goes back he's hoping that Magnus gives a check and goes into Queen vs Rook but no such luck Magnus goes rook f8 and the check means he then later goes King G6 and Nets a full Rook with the pawn queening with this Magnus Carlsen is completely winning sachenko shaking his head has his hand on his head he knows that it's all over game over handshake Magnus Carlsen has done it from an equal position he scores a brilliant win"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

randin in the first round has the white pieces mukesh's live rating is 2751 and he manages to win two back-to-back games he becomes the India number one off we go kukesh opens with one E4 the thing about gukesh is that he can actually play one D4 as well and one E4 as well he's good with both these moves so today he starts off with one E4 and it's not so easy to prepare against him E5 played by skandarov and now the Knight comes out to F3 the time control is 90 minutes for 40 moves then additional 30 minutes and also 30 second increment per move Mukesh goes for the traditional rui Lopez the Spanish opening A6 played here it's always nice to see these youngsters playing openings which have been in fashion for years and years together Bishop comes back to A4 this is the rui Lopez Main Line Knight to F6 attacking the pawn the Main Moon now is castles and gukesh goes for it if you take the pawn on e4 that would lead to the open variation of the rui Lopez right now he goes Bishop to E7 very logical the closed variation rookie one played and now Black Goes B5 asking the bishop to move away from the pressure of the Knight on C6 and the bishop comes back to B3 there are two main moves here D6 and short Castle Black Goes short castle and here as white you have to decide if you play the move C3 then D5 leads to the martial attack and therefore D3 is known as the anti-marshall now D6 very solid play with the pawn on E5 defended your threat is Knight A5 to win this important Bishop so gukesh makes space for it with C3 the Knight anyway comes to A5 to attack it and now the bishop of course has to be saved this is the critical Bishop in this opening so Bishop goes back to C2 and black takes space in the center with C5 this is the thing about this opening white is sort of looking low on space but his ideas are very common you go Knight F1 Knight G3 you hit the center with hit the queen side with A4 and these are the plans the Knight comes back to C6 and now gukesh plays a spawn up to H3 all useful moves rookie 8 played by black and gukesh now goes A4 look at the time on his clock he has one hour 31 minutes and 30 seconds gukesh is here along with his second Gregor's guyevsky who helps him with all his preparations and this seems to be a position he knows first point where Mukesh thought he goes Knight F1 H6 by misrat din later on that move can be handy ab5 taken the Rook is now activated along the a file opponent takes the pawn back and now will he continue normally with Knight G3 or E3 no gukesh goes for the central breakthrough with D4 which is a very useful move now black takes CD and of course gukesh will recapture back with the pawn CD and now how do you continue because if white gets this move D5 should be doing pretty well so he takes on D4 again the best move in the position and now Mukesh has actually fallen behind in on the clock as compared to his opponent which means the last couple of movies thought a lot he takes with the Knight on D4 and misrat then takes the Knight as well Knight takes D4 and of course gukesh takes it back with his queen queen takes D4 let's take stock of the position black has a weakness on D6 but in return He has free flowing development here there you can see the bishop comes out and if he can get a successful D5 it would be his position would do well here Mukesh now plays Bishop F4 and puts pressure on the d-pawn you can't play defy your Rook is hanging on B8 so very logical move is Rook to C8 attacking the bishop whoa nice move by gukesh there the bishop and queen form a battery towards X7 and this can become very important this was a good move an idea here is 97 to put the Knight on C5 or E5 but he goes Bishop C4 attacking the Queen the queen has to move goes back to D1 and I think gukesh liked that he provoked the bishop to come to C4 and then went back to D1 D5 played but E5 comes on the board now gokesh's position looking very good knight E4 and I think the best move now is to go Knight E3 but gukesh look at the amount of time he's taught here he's taken close to 30 minutes to decide what to do and then plays his Queen to G4 but you know what this allows Bishop takes F1 here that is the problem that this move is possible but Knight E3 would have been a better choice there to attack he takes the Knight Bishop takes F1 and now if you take Rook takes F1 then black is doing completely fine in that position so First bishop uh gukesh chops off the Knight on e4 with his Bishop D takes E4 important move if you didn't take it and if you would have saved your Bishop then already Bishop takes F6 was very strong so D4 and now gukesh plays an intermediate move threatening a mate in one there's no time to save this bishop Bishop drops back to f8 it seems like vukesh is doing well but actually misrat din has things under control because E5 Pawn is hanging Rook takes E5 played as of now both sides have four pawns each and the position is close to equal but Gucci says your queen is a bit overloaded your Rook is attacked by my queen and therefore Queen E8 is the best move Bishop now drops back to F4 and Rook E6 nice play for the time being the azeri player is giving Mukesh a great fight gukesh goes Rook D5 attacking the pawn on B5 Rook to C5 played again a nice move there and now Rook D2 but this allows a simplifying move E3 is possible fe3 rookie 3 Bishop E3 Queen E3 Rook F2 Rook C2 followed by Bishop coming here would have led to a draw so actually if Miss radhin can find this move E3 he can actually get a draw against Mukesh with the black pieces and in this world cup format that would be something very important he's taking his time but no he plays Queen C6 this is not the best move here because E3 would have been the best but now gukesh actually is happy he comes back Queen D1 nice move the queen moves back and now the Rook can move in also the bishop can drop back Rook goes to E8 trying to cover the last rank but now Bishop E3 you will see how all of a sudden almost imperceptibly gukesh has put his pieces on squares which are much better like The Rook will come here now yes he gets it and these two Rooks are on highways and suddenly the black rocks are completely boxed in how did this happen you know this happens when you're facing a good opponent suddenly your pieces go on to squares which you never thought they would go to now is on the seventh the other is planning to join in rookie 6 played his idea is to trade off one of the Rooks here with Rook D6 what should gukesh do now because if he goes Rook C7 trying to come here Rook D6 would trade and he goes rook d8 and he tells his opponent if you go Rook D6 I'll take on E8 if you take my queen I'll get two Rooks for the queen so he goes King at seven the big blunder year gukesh moves in with four minutes both his Rooks have arrived on the last rank Mishra then under big pressure he defends his Rook here with the queen vard gukesh now brings in the third attacker with Queen D7 suddenly everything's hanging Rook takes d8 you can literally sense that Black's position sort of fell apart in couple of moves if the bishop moves there's Queen h8 mate and so he goes Rook F6 trying to prevent that mate but now gukesh as Bishop coming to C5 no he first plays bd4 asking The Rook where it wants to go Rook comes back to F7 and now gukesh can simply Place Bishop to C5 the bishop will be lost because if you take Queen h8 is a Checkmate and he plays it misrat then down to his last couple of seconds whoa in fact he has 40 min actually 40 moves are done so he thought for 30 minutes there he thought for another 17 minutes he got an extra 30 minutes and resigned gukesh comes Shake of hands placing the king in the center what I really like about bhukesh is that he's not too excited after winning very calm cool composed one of his idols is Mahendra Singh dhoni and uhukesh really follows him and I think he's got this very calm look inspired from him there you have it he's putting back all of his pieces again it's a habit that gukesh has since a very young age to put the pieces back on the board and uh it started off well for him he's moved on to two seven five four with this game and also reached top 10 in the world all the players have been given a sheet to sign maybe it's related to some kind of either a dress code or the prize money or some taxes something related to it so they all have to sign but bhukesh now just 0.6 ELO away from vishyanand and breaking India breaking through to India number one but already the young boy at the age of 17 has broken in to top 10 in the world what an amazing feat by gukesh he's playing some phenomenal chess if he wins tomorrow with the black pieces against Miss rajdhin then he actually breaks into the uh as India number one and this would happen after many many years that Anand would be dislodged from the top spot but I think that might happen although a bit of a problem for gukesh is that he's already you know in order to win the match against Mishra then he only needs a drop so that will be a point of conflict but I think Mukesh really likes to play uh uncompromising chess in every single game and he'll do that there you have it I hope you enjoyed the game versus nisrat din round number one [Music] good"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following

Divya has had a good tournament until now she has beaten GM Hong tan Trang in the second round and now in the third round of the World Cup she takes on a very formidable opponent in goryachikina we have the English opening on the board and Divya goes for the Queen's Gambit setup twins can be declined setup with E6 D5 Orange Bishop comes out to G2 and now Divya brings out her Knight to F6 this is a great experience for a player like Divya to face such a amazing player like goriatricina and she's going to go all out she plays D4 now this is a very ambitious move because you're gaining space and you're telling white that I am ready to spend some time on it but I have more space on the board short Castles by white and Divya brings out her Knight to C6 white can try for D3 followed by E3 break which is kind of a reversed benoni she goes D3 and the other option here is to of course expand on the queen side with A3 B4 Divya plays her Bishop out to C5 which is an interesting way to develop and also kind of telling white that maybe E3 is not the best idea now Knight D2 one of the ideas with this move is to put your knight on D3 Divya pushes the pawn to A5 a very logical move because if the Knight is coming to B3 later on you can push it away with A4 Knight B3 played by goryachkinah and now the bishop drops back and I think it's a good time to strike in the center with E3 because otherwise Divya is threatening A4 to kick the Knight away E3 is played if Divya takes here then after Bishop E3 quite has a fine position so Divya continues to gain more space in the center with E5 with again an ambitious approach Pawn takes now you would want to take back with the pawn she takes it back and now once again there is an idea of pushing A4 but goria goes Bishop G5 if Divya plays A4 then after take take and Knight C5 when the Knight is attacking this Pawn also could come to E4 so Divya does not really go for A4 she castles and Rook E1 is played at 6 asking a question to the bishop and now the bishop has to move away it goes back to D2 and can Divya play A4 here A4 but she's afraid that after take take if she takes on D4 E7 is hanging but here Bishop C5 would have been an excellent move and Divya is completely fine but she goes rookie at slightly passive move and instantly goria plays A4 stopping the a pawn from advancing yes she's weakened the B4 square and div we are now taking advantage of that by bringing her Rook to A6 but on the other hand now the Knight on B3 is very well placed putting pressure here here and here 95 Divya does not trade goes Knight before until now she's been playing excellently the position is complicated but of another fine move for from goria playing her Pawn to C4 maybe the Knight can go back to C4 Knight D7 is a big mistake by Divya she could have played Rook E6 here but Knight D7 and instantly goryachkina spots a beautiful tactic Knight takes A5 now everything's hanging Divya has to take care if she would have taken the Knight then Bishop B4 and white is better but she had this in mind however goria had prepared Knight takes B7 here attacking the queen so you must take the Knight there's no other way Bishop takes B7 now if you take on B7 then E5 is hanging so first you should take on D7 and she does it she takes here the point being that if you take on G2 there is Knight takes C5 so Divya first takes on E1 very important to take with the bishop not with the queen because with the queen then D3 and C2 all come with a Tempo so Bishop takes and now she takes on D7 but in the end of all of these complications you will see that Bishop takes B7 has come and materially white is a pawn up but it's not just any pawn it's this beautiful a passer which is a very strong pawn and goria comes back to E4 with the idea of putting the bishop here maybe and sort of pinning there Knight A6 Divya laser trap if you play Bishop F5 she wants to take here and queen F5 and she's doing completely fine so goriach kinna does not fall for it she plays this very nice move because now if you take take and take the bishop is no longer on E1 and Bishop F5 wins material Bishop f8 is played here and now Pawn up to B5 you can see how white not only has an extra Pawn but also such amazing pieces the Knight comes to C5 but now the bishop is going to move in and that's exactly what goria does Bishop C6 next up you have Bishop coming here Pawn advancing down the board Divya tries to sacrifice and exchange here Queen takes C6 but the main issue remains that White's a pawn is very powerful and goriatricina like a machine keeps pushing that pawn amazing play by her sort of flawless play in the game until now now there's pressure on D3 Pawn but she goes Bishop B4 and now if Knight D3 then you can take on f8 followed by Rook A3 and the D4 Pawn Falls and I think Divya here is totally lost she offers her hand in resignation and goriatricina scores the full point she now leads the match one nil and Divya will have to strike with the white pieces in the second game all in all an amazing game by world number three and a great learning experience for the 17 year old Divya Deshmukh thank you foreign

Geniuses Wei and vasili ivanchu the scores are tied at three draws each two In classical one in Rapid and we are now to game number two of 25 minutes plus 10 seconds increment it's the Italian on the board we has the white pieces and he's the higher rated player here he goes for D4 a very direct approach ivankuk takes one pushes to E5 and D5 is the standard move Bishop B5 pinning the Knight the Knight jumps to E4 and now C takes D4 the bishop drops back and white brings out the Knight castles this is all well-known Theory you can see both the players blitzing out their moves Bishop comes out and Ivan troop now will most likely go and pin the Knight with Bishop to G4 there are some other options as well in this position and perhaps ivankuk is thinking about them goes Bishop G4 where he asks a question I want to goes back and now the main line here is to play Queen to C2 and where he plays it now if you take here then you spoil the structure but the ninth has to move and this is not a good idea so Bishop G6 is the main line and now Queen B3 putting pressure here on the center on the D5 Square and Ivan chook now goes Knight back to E7 defending way castles this is all preparation and now black can bolster his Pawn chain with the move C6 then everything is well coordinated yes he plays his Pawn up to C6 and now Bishop D3 in this position Knight F5 is one move but there's also this little tactical idea Knight D2 where you Fork the two pieces it might seem like way has missed it but actually this is all well-known Theory and you can get to know from where his time he still has 26 minutes 30 seconds he want does win an important Bishop but at the same time now there are ideas like Knight A4 hitting the bishop and also this piece so white has the space advantage and a pretty decent position you can see one trying to recollect his analysis and here he goes for Knight F5 this is actually a very interesting move because he's putting pressure on the D4 Pawn and Wei now goes Knight to A4 and he says your Bishop is hanging vasili you can't take on D4 but here Ivan chuk has a very interesting idea he can play Bishop to C4 which he does when if you take here take your queen takes then after Bishop takes D4 the position is fine Ivan Chuck knows this and so does way so ways does not take the pawn he does not take Knight takes C4 he goes Queen C3 and Ivan chuk now attacks the queen with Bishop A5 oh well he doesn't leave that Bishop he's unsure but he plays it and that's a fine move but B4 is possible and after that you can drop back your Bishop to C7 now you can't take twice because B5 would win a piece but where he goes Queen C2 which is also fine and now he's attacking this Knight on F5 don't forget that Knight Evancho chops off on D2 Queen takes D2 and now plays his Pawn up to B6 so that the Knight cannot settle down on the C5 Square it's opposite colored Bishops on the board so there could be attacking chances for both sides but currently it looks like black could never have an attacking chance you know his pieces are quite passively positioned but uh who knows at some point Ivan chuk can conjure up an attack Rook a D1 played now very surprising I thought he would put Rook to C1 on the open file but maybe he's angling against C5 so that the D5 Pawn would be under pressure making good use of his time he plays Queen D7 connects his Rooks defends the C6 pawn and later on wants to go F6 Bishop F4 played and now the Rook is planning to come into the center yes he does Rook ae8 played so the game is getting very exciting because Ivan took now maybe can get his Rook swinging over there Queen C3 by way putting pressure perhaps on the C6 point and now rookie 6 is interesting but there's also a nice break here ivankuk plays it F6 and with this he's getting in another piece wow this is getting very exciting where he takes the pawn and now Ivan chuk can take back with the Rook activating his rook in the position yes he takes it Rook takes F6 now very important to note here that The Rook is active and also it defends this C6 pawns after rookie one Ivan took his free to move his Queen away from the Pawn on C6 he can actually go Queen to F7 and he does play Queen F7 nice move there by Ivan chook three pieces already lined up near the white king and this Knight on A4 needs to quickly get back into the game he goes Bishop E5 Rook G6 played the interesting moment of the game coming up now Knight B2 should be tried the Knight should not stay too far away from the main King H2 is a mistake now why is it a mistake because there's a beautiful move C5 D take C5 D4 and you deflect the bishop because if you go Knight H4 directly the bishop is coming to G3 ivankuk finds it look at this brilliant idea D4 opening up the bishop here if you take your Bishop p7 his game over wow what a move I want to Queen F3 is actually a mistake you can see one troops face that he feels that it's wrong this was such a brilliant move there and suddenly where he's in a lost position you want you can simply take on D4 that's what he does and he tells me what's the point you just blundered upon well where he takes takes and maybe his idea was that after Bishop takes on D4 he would be able to double up Ivan chook's Pawns takes the pawn takes Rook D1 and now Evancho can save the pawn with D3 but then Knight B2 comes so he finds this amazing move again Rook C6 because now when you take the pawn the problem is King E6 look at his pieces how active they are if you go back to sort of guard the second rank then the king comes up Pawn is pushing forward the Knight is doing absolutely nothing he goes Knight B2 trying to activate the Knight but now the black Rook is coming in you want to plays Rook to C2 brilliant chess 91 chops off the pawn on A2 he spawn up his King is active he has a passer is Evancho going to knock out way from the tournament the Knight comes to C3 creating a double attack on the rook and the pawn here on D5 but now Evancho can actually take another Pawn here which is Rook takes F2 and he takes it Knight takes D5 and now you can see one took shaking a bit there of course he's a bit nervous but he also has years of experience on his side all he needs to do is just bring that all together and take this game to its logical conclusion can he do that first brings his King right in the center of the board Rook to D1 and now can we just bring the bishop back and attack here that would be an epic idea here Ivan chook finds it Bishop D7 the way he makes his moves is very cool he places the piece and does not let it go instantly you know he checks whether everything is right or not Knight E3 Wade tries to sort of defend the G2 Pawn with his Knight but now the king can even come in further or you can even attack it with the Rook he goes rookie Two Fine move because now Rook takes E3 is hanging if you move the Knight then the G2 Pawn is hanging with the bishop looking here so Wayne tries to move his rook in and he wants you can sense it the victory is so close now the night is hanging and in fact he goes Bishop E4 places his Bishop right in the center of the board very nice move there suddenly where does the night go now he goes Knight to C4 check but you can attack The Rook can't you that would be a good move but he goes King F6 which is even stronger because there's no way to sort of stop this and weighs down to two minutes on the clock he plays his Knight to D6 and now Rook takes G2 is hanging here he can just take it there's also King E6 coming up any one shook is thinking he's enjoying himself you can see him just moving their King E6 played he brings his King in way he resigns and he wants took wins it goes through to the next round in round number four the great Chucky the genius is playing some phenomenal chess and that move C5 is something we should have a look at again in this position evanchook has one two and three pieces into the attack he can go Knight H4 and try to attack here but then the bishop drops back and there's nothing much happening so what does he come up with he comes up with this ingenious idea of pushing the pawn to C5 and after Pawn takes here he again this didn't happen in the game very blundered with Queen to F3 but the critical line was to play dtec C5 and then after D4 it would open up this Bishop's diagonal so two options one is to take the pawn but even if you don't and you move your queen back then Bishop B7 now if you go Bishop G3 that does not work because now you have four pieces into the attack and a very strong move is H5 with the idea of H4 and white is in big trouble and after Queen D2 if you hear play the move F3 then Knight H4 and now G2 is hanging and if you play Bishop E3 then already takes Pawn takes Queen takes with G3 hanging here Queen F2 take take and Rook G2 you can see how the attack plays itself and evanchook is winning so this idea of C5 D take C5 D4 to open up this diagonal and bring another piece into the attack was absolutely brilliant Chess By vasili [Music] [Applause] thank you"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess

day of Prague being 17 as tomorrow is his birthday 18th birthday for now Hikaru opens the game with one C4 the English opening Prague has this sort of ritual in this tournament where he spends around 30 to 40 seconds before making his first move and today also he seems to be following it we have seen Hikaru and Prague face off against each other in tata steel chess India back in the day in 2018 to be precise when Prague was just 13 years old now Prague has become one of the most prodigious young talents in the world and also a world-class GM while Hikaru of course has stopped playing chess professionally but is playing some of the most brilliant chess of his life Prague brings out his Knight to F6 a flexible move you don't know which setup black will go for E6 G6 he goes Knight to C3 and now Prague has to decide what is he going to do he goes for the symmetrical variation with Pawn up to C5 and Hikaru now can bring his Knight out here he goes G3 and with this move you want to fear and shatter your Bishop on the long diagonal now black can also feature to it or can go Knight C6 he can also play some other moves but Prague goes for the very direct Pawn up to D5 and this is actually a very very interesting system the reason is after Pawn takes Knight takes you will see that black is playing very ambitiously first of all he's moved the same piece twice in order to recapture it and secondly when the bishop attacks the Knight now which Hikaru will most likely do yes he attacks the Knight now the Knight does not go in and exchange but rather it goes back here to C7 which is the main line and you might be wondering what exactly is black doing yes Knight C7 played by Prague because he's undeveloped white has not just two pieces his third piece is coming out but the point is after Knight F3 black is going to play his Knight up to C6 and then play E5 creating this bind in the center it's also known as the maroxy bind generally happens with the white pieces when they have pawns on e4 and C4 but here with Knight C6 Prague is angling to play the E5 move Hikaru plays Pawn up to D3 and here Prague if he manages to get a few moves rolling which is E5 Bishop E7 castles Bishop E6 Pawn up to F6 Queen D7 B6 you know if you get all these moves flowing then white would be low on space and would be in trouble that's the reason why Hikaru rotates his knight from D2 to C4 and his idea is on one hand he may want to take on C6 and spoil black structure but you mustn't forget you're giving up an important Bishop so Prague says Hikaru come and take my knight if you want Hikaru says not now now I am threatening because I can take take and then pick up your Central Pawn as well so Prague can actually defend it but he castles and look at the time on the clock of Prague this is still his prep and the point is if you take take 95 he wants to go Bishop F6 takes here take take and this is quite okay because Knight F5 I can stop you from castling Hikaru feels it you know he sees that his opponent is well prepared and this is experience coming into play he doesn't take the pawn and now Prague finally saves his Central Pawn now Hikaru has one one hour 25 minutes in fact he's thought now for eight minutes Prague still with almost all of his time and now hits the center with F4 but then Hikaru will develop his Bishop here he takes it and now Bishop takes F4 most likely will be on the board after Pawn takes Hikaru now takes the pawn with his Bishop so white has a lot of Peace activity you know here but at the same time none of his pieces are very solidly placed like the Knight can go and attack this Pawn can come up forward in the future and hit this Knight 96 played and also this Square on D4 is a very nice Square for the Black Knights because whenever white pushes it away with E3 his Central pawns become weak Hikaru plays his Bishop to D2 and he was a bit worried about trucks preparation in as he said in his recap he felt that Prague is very well prepared at this point and he wanted to get out of theory Prague now plays his Bishop up to D7 and no longer can Hikaru take the Knight on C6 and spoil the structure well the Knight jumps into the Central Square you can see the white Knights doing really well here a good move for Prague would be Bishop E8 because anyway he's okay with giving up this bishop and then rerouting the bishop perhaps to a square like this but instead Prague plays the moon Rook B8 and this is a very interesting move he wants to play his Pawn up to B5 and Hikaru makes an extremely committal decision he weakens his D4 Square the two knights are eyeing that but he says my knight on D5 is very Solid Truck hits the Knight with the pawn up to B5 and Hikaru can now rotate his Knight to E3 looking at the central squares but rather he goes Knight takes E7 because he felt that if he goes Knight C3 Prague might go Bishop D6 and put his Bishop here on this Square so that's the reason why he first took Queen takes and now he's going to play his Knight to E3 via D5 time wise Hikaru has caught up with Prague in fact Prague to 51 minutes Hikaru also has 51 minutes on the clock Knight comes to E3 has many many ideas here he can put one of his Knights here but hikaru's Knight is coming to the center as well Supra plays his E Knight to D4 and uh yeah maybe the other Knight could also have come in he goes Knight D5 attacking the Queen the queen has to move but with square Prague here decides to play Queen to D6 and now Hikaru can actually go and attack the queen he can play his Bishop to F4 this is what he does he plays his bishop and Prague now has to block of course with Knight E5 that was the idea because if the queen moves The Rook is hanging so that's the reason why Knight E5 makes a lot of sense and you can see that black is going to have a very firm control of the dark squares in the centers and in order to break it Hikaru should have played B4 now and the point is after Queen D2 Queen F2 here let's say this is already getting jittery for black in the center but Hikaru blunders now actually this is you can't say it's a blunder but a very serious mistake who's now B4 his idea is before but black can stop it with Pawn up to B4 will Prague find this move yes he does he understands that he had to prevent Hikaru for playing B4 and also makes the square B5 available for the bishop you can feel that Hikaru is under pressure Hikaru plays Rook C1 and this is where his fighting spirit will definitely kick in because now the position is not so great Prague can go Bishop here will along with his Knight attack this he plays his Rook up to C8 and he defends this Pawn it's a normal move it defends it and maybe later on Prague can start pushing his a pawn down the board Hikaru plays his Pawn up to H3 and his idea is maybe later to go G4 make space for his Bishop to come back position is getting quite intense Bishop B5 the pawn on D3 is attacked here and now Hikaru plays his Rook up to F2 you cannot take here by the way if you take here I have Bishop takes E5 and the queen is hanging so right now D3 is defended Prague again makes a preparatory move with King h8 and Hikaru pushes his Pawn here somewhere Prague has to make some some choices he can push his Pawn up to B3 he can also go A5 A4 there are many many plants in the position he goes Knight back to E6 and attacks the bishop now the bishop can drop back to G3 and this is very much possible but in fact Hikaru makes a very very interesting decision he plays his Bishop back to F1 and let's pruck to take this bishop here which is actually an important piece in White's Camp he takes it because now the dark squares become even further weakened so Prague takes the bishop he has seven minutes you are on move number 25 so you have 15 more moves to make in those seven minutes to reach move 40 and then you would get an additional 30 minutes on the clock so both players going to Face Time trouble Queen comes out again you can't take here take here and Knight takes because the queen would be hanging and that's the reason why Prague plays his Queen back uh Bishop back to C6 he wants to take the Knight and win upon if he manages to exchange the bishop for the night then positionally black would be way better but he goes Knight to E3 now Prague can actually reroute his Bishop wire D7 to E6 that's exactly what he's doing on E6 the bishop would kind of dominate The Knight because wherever it went it can trade it so Knight C4 played and now very important for Prague to Place Queen here because after takes takes this Rook is pinned so it's a very good position to play Queen to D4 and can Prague find this move no he does not he plays Queen E7 and now things are going to be traded off the knights are going to be exchanged and the position would be roughly around equal Rook fc2 you can see that Hikaru is building up pressure on the C5 Pawn this is a good move here cannot go Bishop E6 because if he does so I can take take and take this Pawn when white is better but he first takes on C4 Hikaru catches back now while Prague is going to go Bishop E6 and attack the pawn on A2 the C5 Pawn of black is also very weak and look at prague's time he's down to one minute 40 seconds he attacks Bishop E6 but you can suddenly feel the tide turning in hikaru's favor he's playing quickly he has six minutes 25 seconds on the clock we are at Moon number 31 Prague has to make nine moves in uh in just one minute 40 seconds he takes on A2 but now you can push your Pawn to D4 you can't take because the Rook is hanging this is a strong move but Hikaru comes Queen E3 and he tells Prague your Pawn on C5 is hanging how do you defend it well maybe you don't defend it you just play upon up to A5 but truck plays his Pawn to C4 and Hikaru simply takes it now this bishop is all no strap if white gets B3 he's winning so Prague goes and says let's trade the Queens because then you can't get B3 easily I can take Bishop B3 and so Queen takes on C5 Rook takes C5 has occurred on the board and now Hikaru plays his Rook to D2 this is getting very sharp because you might think that the position is kind of dull and dryish but Hikaru has some very interesting plans first of all this is not hanging because when you take take take Rook takes there's a back rank mate and so Hikaru finds a great smoking F2 Prague should now maybe get rid of his background problems with G6 but he makes a mistake with A5 now all of a sudden hikaru's Rook is coming here then his King comes up King comes up here and already it's trouble time Rook D5 what a brilliant move he's actually turning on the heat he's winning this game right now prank goes A4 but now King E3 is a brilliant move because after A3 ba3 B3 there is this very nice move rook cd1 and Prague is in trouble but instead Hikaru plunders with Bishop e Bishop D3 you can say this is a big error because now Prague is back in the game he gets King G8 and you are not in time to execute this idea black is getting counter play now on the queen side with Pawn up to A3 so King E3 played and now Prague can actually even go back in this position with Rook C7 keeping the two Rooks on the board his Pawn on A5 is no longer hanging so Rook goes here and now the main main move here is Rook A5 to put pressure here but after Bishop B3 black is doing pretty fine so Hikaru moves in the center with King to D4 he plays his King up the board and now black plays what's his idea this is the 40th move prank down to four three he plays Rook B8 and both players gonna get an additional 30 minutes Rook B8 is a decent move now Hikaru after thinking for nearly 14 minutes finds this amazing move you can't take the Rook because these two Central pawns are very strong and you can literally sense it that Hikaru is playing for the win Prague also thinking for nearly 13 minutes now and plays King f8 he says I don't want to touch that pawn and now Rook A1 should be a good move because then you you can't take the Rook still that would give two strong pawns and if the bishop D3 there is this move Bishop C4 and you can continue playing in this end game white is better but Hikaru plays Rook F1 this is the final inaccuracy which gives pragnananda the counter play he was looking for here A3 is a classy move because if you take B takes A3 I'm going to take back and now the a pawn is very very strong so Hikaru plays Rook A1 and he tells Prague hey your Bishop is hanging if you take here I'll take this this square is controlled so what's your plan Prague says my plan is to go Bishop B3 but isn't the pawn hanging takes takes and Rook takes we all know that Bishop takes D5 is not an option because it strengthens White's position has to find this very accurate move Rook A7 not Rook A8 because later on it can be some Troublesome after A4 and you know the last rank gets weakened so Rook a seven truck finds it he finds this very very nice move and I think Hikaru now goes Rook D6 Prague is equal the position looks pretty good for pregnant he has the strong a pawn that is working out for him and takes B takes A3 now this Pawn will come up to A2 yes white skin is active he also has the C Pawn so the position would get around equalized whenever the Bishops are traded but as of now praknananda has done his job he has managed to equalize Rook B6 played and a draw is offered by Hikaru is shaking his head he knew that he had his chances after move 40 pragnananda has a hard thing on the board should he accept the draw or not four minutes that's the thing he wants to play on and now he accepts the draw and there you are there you have them analyzing the game together if the game ends in a draw tomorrow as well then they go into the tie breaks but whoever wins will have the advantage and it's wonderful to see both of them analyzing with each other that's that's very cool to see and Prague will have his birthday on the 10th of August and will also have the white pieces he'll be turning 18. and uh Hikaru will be will have to be careful playing with the black pieces but of course it's a match everyone's been looking forward to uh here and both the players are also quite happy to play against each other you can see them analyzing even now after the game and uh yeah yeah very very complex game both players had their chances it was Prague who was pressing first then Hikaru was pressing and eventually the game has ended in a draw [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary

the free day World Cup 2023 and we are ready to go Vincent with the white pieces opens the game with one D4 and Magnus as is usual with him writes down his score sheet he doesn't worry about the time ticking down on his clock but his opponent is not an easy one that he's facing Vincent is an amazing player he's just 18 years old and people claim that he's the biggest hope for Germany having a world champion since the great Emmanuel Lasker the second world champion Vincent today is facing the strongest player on the planet Magnus Carlsen it's a two game mini match between them and Magnus with the black pieces would be looking to give his best but a draw would not be such a bad result Magnus adjusts all his pieces and we are ready to go will he play D5 here will he play Knight to F6 remains to be seen he puts his Knight on F6 and now Vincent moves his Pawn up to C4 how does Magnus continue here he goes for E6 a very very solid opening choice and Vincent is ready for the nimzo Indian he plays Knight to C3 and now one idea is to play nimzo Indian the other one is to play D5 which is the Queen's Gambit declined well Queens Gambit declined is a little bit you can say more solid in nature than nimzo nimzo is more active if you get your Bishop here let's see what what Magnus chooses and he goes for D5 striking in the center and Vincent goes for ctex defy The Exchange variation of the Queen's Gambit decline it also leads to the Carlsbad structure this structure with two pawns here and Five Pawns in a clump and also four here for black and three is known as the Carlsbad structure Bishop comes to G5 and pins the Knight now the threat is to take the Knight Queen takes and pick up the pawn on D5 Magnus plays Bishop D4 and suddenly from the Queen's Gambit decline territory we are in the ragozan territory so Bishop B4 played by Magnus and now Vincent plays The Very solid move E3 white has a very strong Center Magnus has peace activity he plays H6 and right now white can take the Knight he can move his Bishop back or he can also Place Bishop back to F4 Vincent decides to play his Bishop back to F4 and now there are again many options one of them is to strike in the center with C5 but Magnus plays Bishop to F5 and generally when you can get your Bishop here white has these plans of Queen B3 but here Knight C6 is what Magnus intends so Vincent goes for a very simple move Bishop D3 offering a trade of the Bishops Magnus simply chops it off he's like this is fine for me completely I have no problems my that was not my great Bishop because my Central Pawn is on the light squares you know I'm going to play C6 so this is my good Bishop here so I'm happy to exchange the other Bishop he plays C6 and now bolsters his Pawn chain if we take stock out of the opening it seems like Magnus has equalized here although we are still moving on Knight E2 played by Vincent and uh he's placed his Knight on this Square not on F3 and Magnus instantly goes Knight H5 attacking the bishop you may want to just drop your Bishop back to G3 or you may want to take this Knight that's one option there is also a possibility of playing Bishop to E5 and placing the bishop on that square F6 is impossible because of Queen G6 check so Vincent does go Bishop E5 Magnus has been moving pretty quickly out of the opening he has one hour 27 minutes Vincent has 1 hour 16 minutes night on D7 attacks the bishop on E5 and now what do you do actually that peace is maybe not even hanging I mean black is not even threatening because once white takes D takes E5 this Knight is kind of Trapped so H3 interesting move now imagine if you took here then D takes E5 my threat is G4 to trap the Knight you may have to go move like G6 and it already feels very weakening this entire thing so Magnus does not take he goes first back with his Knight and now he's really threatening to take because after d takes E5 he can move his Knight back to D7 Vincent goes back to H2 and Magnus castles it out he is okay with this uh he he castles and now what does Vincent do will he also Castle he plays A3 and tells Magnus to decide if he takes on C3 this would definitely be a small Edge to White so Magnus keeps the bishop he plays Bishop A5 and maybe he hopes to trade off the bishop with Bishop C7 perhaps Vincent castles here and some of the very useful moves for black are rookie 8 Queen E7 and so on so Rook E8 played by Magnus and now Vincent plays his Rook to C1 he wants to perhaps go for a minority attack with B4 B5 which could be a very good idea Magnus plays his Queen to E7 very interesting decision here now can Vincent play before because earlier Bishop C1 C7 was possible but now the queen has moved to E7 so the bishop can be taken also if you go B4 and Bishop goes to B6 then Vincent might want to go Knight A4 putting pressure on B6 and C5 squares so all in all that seems like a interesting way to continue in the position and Vincent has one idea on that front also the other idea is to play Rook E1 eventually try for the F3 for break but he goes for B4 which feels like the right way to continue in this position and now what does Magnus uh do here he goes Bishop d8 so he places his Bishop on the d8 square and now if you play B5 Magnus is one of the idea was that he could snatch this Pawn that was the plan so Knight G3 player by Vincent and his point is that my knight is coming on the very good F5 square and if you were to play G6 that weakens your king side a bit Magnus very very alert to every single possibility plays his Bishop to C7 and if you go Knight F5 attacking the queen he will First Take on H2 with a check and that's the reason why Bishop C7 is a nice move Knight F5 anyway Vincent plays it Magnus first takes on H2 gives a check Vincent picks up that Bishop and now where will the queen go the queen could go back to d8 but it's little passive because then white will play F3 and E4 the queen could go to E6 and that seems more logical the queen is well placed here so the queen comes up to E6 right now the position is very very equal even uh as we say and here Vincent brings back his Knight so Magnus has won the sort of opening battle with the black pieces but now starts the new challenge how do you actually create play with the black pieces one plan can be to get your knight from B6 to C4 but first Magnus goes Queen D6 and he pins the Knight here and maybe he's aiming at H5 H4 in the air and look at the time on the clock Magnus has close to 15 minute lead there and he goes King G1 and now maybe Knight B6 Knight C4 does seem like a good plan but in fact Magnus plays A5 he plays on The Queen side but now Vincent Again Play pushing the pawn would mean he would lose the A3 Pawn so he goes Queen B1 and a very typical idea in this position is to go B5 this is very very common yes you weaken the C6 Pawn but very very quickly you're getting your knight here and your knight to C4 so that does feel like a good idea for Magnus to push his Pawn to B5 what is Magnus going to play he goes Knight to B6 and this is a very interesting move because if you take here now notice the Knight is hanging and so is the pawn so you can't recapture you have to go Knight C4 and Vincent has taken he's taken that pawn Magnus has to go Knight C uh four now if you take this Pawn on B7 then Rook eb8 traps the queen there's no way for the queen to go so Knight C4 is a must here yes Magnus plays his Knight to C4 and also notice there is a fork coming in so Vincent was ready with his move he plays Queen to B4 and he says to Magnus you can't take on A3 because your queen would hang and if you take here then a B4 my position is way better but Magnus takes the pawn on A5 now the ninth year defends this and this so it seems like this Knight is slightly over um worked for the time being and Vincent goes for a small little tactic with Knight takes D5 but this is not a big surprise for Magnus he's already seen it he takes back with the Knight and now Vincent takes Queen Tech C4 but the A3 Pawn is hanging and with all these things that have happened let's let Magnus take that pawn on A3 yes he takes it with all that has happened the pawn structure has changed quite a lot white has Five Pawns here while black has to pawn Island so why does one Island black has two so definitely Pawn structure wise white should be doing well but on the other hand black does have an outside past pawn queen C5 played offering the queen for trade and now what does Magnus do he takes and of course Vincent wants should take with the Rook here not with the pawn that would spoil his structure and he takes with the Rook so Rook take C5 has been played now white as a clear plan to put the Rook on B1 pressurize the B7 point but what is magnus's plan he goes rookate and he tells Vincent that the moment you start putting pressure on the B7 Pawn I'm coming Rook A1 but first Vincent was Knight F5 now this is a pesky night here it can't be kicked away because that sixth Pawn is hanging but the Knight is also ready to jump to D6 to put pressure on the B7 point well Magnus firstly plays H5 a useful move to make because later on G6 would mean that the X6 Pawn is not hanging so a good decision there by Magnus to push H5 and wince and gain some space on the king side as well he goes G4 the time situation is Vincent has 9 minutes 50 seconds Magnus has 53 minutes we are down we are on Moon number 31 right now so nine more moves to go before move 40 H takes G4 played now do you do you kick the Knight away with G6 but then there's Knight B6 so Magnus plays Rook A2 and he is trying for his own counter play Let's imagine he can get Rook B2 and the other Rook comes to A2 that would be something you know that would mean that he has a lot of active possibilities here so Vincent first tops Rook B2 and also starts his own play with Rook B1 on the B7 pawn and Magnus says I want to exchange the the Rooks here so he plays Rook A1 take Vincent takes it and now Rook takes check you have to move your king up King G2 play now one idea is to play King f8 and get your king here still G6 is perhaps possible you know if you go here you might want to play Rook B1 but then that is Rook A5 and The Rook is entering Y at this side so you don't want to do this so he played the move King f8 and now comes the move G5 he gains further space on the king side and he is angling to sort of put pressure on these pawns I think it's a good time to actually push the pawn to G6 now for for Magnus he's trying to move the Knight but that could be a mistake oh maybe he wants to go 97 to trade the knights no he plays Knight C7 and this is a big big mistake look at Vincent's Expressions carefully he looks at the position very very with deep concentration and he looks at Magnus and then looks at a distance and then again sits back in his chair and then comes in he knows that Knight T6 is now very strong because it attacks B7 and also the F7 point with Rook F5 coming it's actually a very powerful move so Vincent after having a good look at his opponent plays the Moon Knight D6 very powerful now if you look at Magnus he's not yet understood that his last move was a blunder if you look at him he's still pretty cool calm composed and he's looking at what should he play as his next move here his idea was this move Rook B1 and if he plays it he does defend B7 but what about Rook to F5 putting pressure here he can't defend and look he even moves his hand to the rook and then stops and then suddenly notices oh my God Rook F5 is coming what am I going to do if I play Rook B1 and now Magnus is Expressions completely change at this point he starts looking there he's realized he's gone wrong and now tries to focus hard shaking his head there this is what happens when chess plays even to the best of the best in the business the position was equal but a lapse in concentration and suddenly you are in trouble and look at Vincent his confidence keeps Rising Magnus can't believe what he has just done from a completely fine position just one move has shifted everything in his opponent's favor trying his best to see what is the way in which he can create maximum play 96 was one of his ideas why he wanted to play his Knight to C7 but now after Rook F5 or even Rook E5 which is a very powerful move because now B7 is hanging and if you try to defend it there's already this amazing mode G6 just hacking at the structure and the Knight is hanging Magnus is sitting there with his head in his hands he just doesn't know what to do now he's just sort of he you know it's a nightmare for a strong player because from a completely fine position when you land into this situation you just don't want to play there you have it Magnus says I don't want to play this position anymore it that's the kind of expression but chess makes you take up sort of responsibility for your decision and Magnus has to make his next move he has to play something he has still 37 minutes on the clock Vincent has six minutes we are just three moves away from reaching move 40. guess either you want to defend B7 but then this is hanging on on F7 or you want to stop Rook F5 you want to play the move G6 foreign has been thinking for a good 10-15 minutes now he's down to 32 minutes on the clock and finally makes this decision of playing the move G6 just dropping one full Pawn on B7 and this is not an ordinary Pawn you once you take it C6 is weak that would mean you would be two points down Vincent instantly chops off the pawn now if it were a lesser player than Vincent of course Magnus would have still given a very strong resistance but with Vincent it's very tough you know he is a world-class GM and after Rook B8 now here's an example like what would you play here with your knight my first instinct was Knight A5 putting pressure here um but you know Vincent actually finds a very very interesting idea he goes 98 and he attacks the pawn from here and also keeps an eye on the F7 Pawn but Magnus has another plan which is to go Rook B5 now if you were to take here then after Rook C5 dc5 Knight E6 this is actually very close to a draw so this you cannot fall into and if you take Rook take C6 then after Rook G5 also you might drop the PO I mean it's still better for white the best movie or and a very very difficult move and Winston only has 20 seconds to play this this is the 40th move is to take and after Pawn takes to go Knight C6 and stop the pawn then you have four pawns versus two and Vincent actually finds it he plays this move C takes B5 played it is the 41st move now Magnus will get more than an hour like he's on 33 so he'll have one hour three minutes Winston plays Knight C6 to stop the pawn gets up from the chair also Magnus gets up he's unhappy both players leave the board they're like we don't want to play this position Vincent wants a break from that intense time travel Magnus went and grabbed a bite he has a new task at hand the task is to somehow survive in this night end game four pawns versus two it seems almost impossible to do it because if the white knight is stopping this Pawn then these pawns will just start rolling for example if Magnus plays Knight D5 with the aim of pushing the pawn here then King F3 B4 Pawn push and now Knight A5 the Knight stops the pawn here so in a way it's not so easy Magnus goes King E8 and he says I'm bringing my king in here and just learn from Vincent how to play Such positions first you blockade the pawn you come back to B4 next up you start rolling your king side pawns so Magnus now has to decide what his move is and he plays the move King to E7 he brings his King up and now with E4 F4 what do you start with is the question okay have to be careful if a moon like E4 suddenly Knight E6 double attacks both these pawns so first F4 just solidifying the entire structure now you want to play E4 but when that happens let's say King D6 now when when E4 is played you don't want the Knight to come and attack both these pawns so you need your king at that point to be on E3 and that's the reason why Vincent brings his King in he's bringing all his pieces and notice how the Knight covers this Square Pawn covers this square if Magnus were to play Knight B5 then after takes takes King E2 this is a winning King Pawn end game because the white king stops these pawns and black king can't do much here so Magnus goes 96 he places his Knight on a decent square and Vincent brings his King to E2 there is definite um benefit in playing this in an unhurried fashion there's no need to hurry just be calm yes you are beating the five-time world champion and also the greatest player on the planet right now but it's it's a one one game you don't need to rush and that's what Vincent is doing right now playing very calmly what is magnus's next decision he goes Knight to G7 he moves his Knight away and now white wants to push the pawn I think that would be a good idea because once the Knight comes back then then we can play King E3 to defend both the pawns so Pawn up to E4 fantastic move played by by white and now Magnus Carlsen goes Knight to H5 attacking the pawn on F4 what does Vincent do now maybe just King E3 is is fine you can also go King F3 and he goes King F3 there are still some subtle pitfalls to to navigate here for for white but the only thing that could lead to him not winning this is if he hurries and uh for an experience 2700 plus player like Vincent this is not going to happen he plays this very calm move Knight to D3 look if you play a move like E5 which is looking mini you are creating some problems for yourself you know you're creating this F5 Square for the night so Vincent actually goes Knight D3 Magnus comes back with his Knight to H5 and now once again if you rush with F5 then after g f e f and maybe okay King D5 there might be Knight of four so first Knight G7 and unfortunately this can get very very tricky so he goes King E3 again a little waiting move asking Magnus what is his plan because now my you know if the king moves away then D5 check could be possible Magnus goes with his Knight to G3 and a very good move now is Pawn up to D5 these Pawn this semi-circular structure is very good because the king is planning to come to D4 he goes King C7 but now King King D4 is great because if you give a check then the king comes up even further to if I eventually to F6 and rounds up these two Pawns so he goes King D4 strong move King moves up the board and Magnus has to decide how is he planning to continue here he goes King to B6 can white now play his King to E5 to F6 is that safe because Magnus now also has a plan to play here he goes Knight E5 this requires some calculation but Vincent has seen it before now the B Pawn is running ahead so if Magnus tries to go and stop with this King then he might lose this E4 Pawn so he goes takes the pawn Magnus pushes it further once again King C3 would be a blunder because Knight E4 leads to a draw so he goes 95 and his point is that you want to give a check when the pawn pushes to B2 and take it so this Pawn is not moving forward and the Knight has come back on time Knight E2 a check to the king and so the King goes back attacking the Knight King E3 and now the King goes to B5 so you could push the pawn down the board to D6 but Winston plays his Knight to D3 of course you cannot take this Knight right now because B2 would just end the game so first 93 very solid and Magnus places Knight to C3 and at this point D6 seems to be the right choice because you're pushing forward yes he pushes his Pawn ahead and if Magnus goes King C6 you can play E5 and if you try Knight A4 to push your Pawn then already a very good idea is F5 G takes F5 and G6 and this Pawn is queening down the board so Magnus does go King C6 and I believe Vincent is going to find the move E5 here Magnus just goes and checks hikaru's position in the background if I've played and next the threat is very powerful F5 is coming in and so at this point Magnus has to think what to do there's nothing much Vincent has two minutes Magnus has 43 minutes 44 minutes and with all this time his position is completely lost you can see Magnus giving a final look at the board and resigns he acknowledges Vincent's good play uh Magnus did blunder big time in this game but Vincent played all the Fantastic moves after it and simply converted this into a win the 18 year old boy has beaten Magnus Carlsen will he be able to win the match not so sure and Magnus placing the pieces back he is upset with himself but he's still very calm because he's not out of the tournament he now has to win with the white pieces in the second game to enforce the tie breaks we'll see if that happens or not but for now a very very big day in the life of Vincent kymer and German chess fantastic play by the youngster

pieces today he's played very well in this tournament beating Vladimir fedociev in round three Java kid cindaro in round four but this one is another challenge Nils Grand Alias he lost to him at the tape Sigmund and Co and now Arjun would be looking to take his revenge there is Nils he comes to the board but Arjun Arjun is deep in his meditation he is very very focused so he doesn't even realize that his opponent is there this is one quality that I am seeing more and more in Indian players with it pragnananda Arjun kind of sitting at the board in a meditative pose and there you see Arjun finishing it and shaking hands with Arjun just getting up from the chair and also Nils there having a very nice smile on his face there we go the game begins and what does grendelius Nils do he's known for his attacking chess he's also very good at openings he opens the game with one E4 now Arjun plays many different systems Sicilian is his main line he also goes for E4 E5 but what is it going to be today he takes his time and plays the French defense that is an interesting opening Choice by Arjun he's going for the French which is considered by many as not as solid as E4 E5 or the Sicilian but Magnus Carlson has been playing it recently and so Arjun of course is very well prepared one of the big strands of Arjun is his opening preparation he's really really good at it we have D4 on the board by Nils and Arjun goes D5 it's also very rare to see two left-handed players against each other on the chess board although it never really matters whether you're making your moves with right hand or left we generally have very few players at the top who play with their left hands one of them is Levon aronian for now we have the classical system with Knight C3 and Arjun doesn't go for the sharp whenever he in fact go in fact goes for Knight F6 Bishop G5 played pinning the Knight and now now there are uh two three main moves one is H6 the other is Bishop E7 here the main line but Arjun goes for the Rubinstein system with d takes E4 this is considered to be slightly passive because you are giving up the center and also giving white a strong Pawn on D4 as compared to your Central Pawn on E6 your Bishop on C8 is slightly passive but it's also a very solid system and I think against a player like Nils Arjun feels this is the right way to go Knight comes to F3 the Knight is pinned for the time being so you can't take on e4 and Arjun comes back and most likely is going to play his Bishop out to E7 to break the PIN and he does that Bishop comes out to E7 now one idea could be Knight G3 but then H6 is possible or even C5 and so Nils here takes on F6 with the Knight and I think you really want to take back with the bishop here if you take with the pawn bishop H6 looks good for white and if you take with the Knight well you are angling for the C5 break so might as well take with the bishop he takes it with the bishop now and Nils has few options he can take here he can play Queen D2 but there's also a slightly aggressive idea which is H4 and he goes for it now uh Arjun doesn't really want to take here because after H takes G5 it really opens up the edge file and clamps these pawns so he castles it out he's not really afraid of nil's attack H4 was just defending the bishop and now uh you need to remove this queen and Castle long because castling shot is no longer an option so he goes Queen E2 he puts his Queen on a square which is not very common you most uh sort of coordinated move looked Queen D2 it was also harmonious because it didn't block the bishop but what Nils wants is that when Arjun strikes in the center with C5 which he has done and it's a good move he wants to Long castle and keep his Rook active down the D file and that's the reason why he has placed his Queen on E2 and there you have Nils long castling here both players are pretty well prepared while Nils has taken some time on the clock and has 1 hour 21 minutes Arjun is up to 1 hour 32. he takes on D4 and now Rook takes on D4 the The Rook has captured the pawn and now uh you would have loved to take the Rook but your queen is still hanging here so Arjun quickly plays Queen A5 and attacks the pawn on A2 Now The Rook is hanging so Nils takes on F6 there is no time for an Intermezzo like more like Queen A2 because the king already has an escape Square here so first you must recapture the bishop with Knight takes F6 and now Nils plays a very very interesting move A4 this was not an expected move I mean generally you would expect him to play King B1 or A3 but the idea of A4 is that later on you want to place your queen on B5 so Rook d8 played by Arjun he's offering a trade of Rooks if he manages to trade Rooks and then goes Bishop D7 and Bishop C6 it would be a good position for for uh black but here there is an intermediate move and Nils seems to want to play it and he plays it Queen to B5 a very very interesting choice now the black queen is defending the Rook so if you take here then Rook takes d8 is possible but there is Queen going back the other option is to Simply Retreat your queen but Arjun takes it he takes on B5 and now Nils of course wanted to take here Rook takes d8 he takes it and Arjun has prepared the move Queen to E8 he brings his Queen back Nils must capture it he takes Knight takes and let's take stock of this position Arjun still has 1 hour 30 minutes on the clock Nils has taken 27 minutes until now it seems like white is slightly better you can see better development the bishop can come out the Knight can move in The Rook can come here and that's what he does but a apart from these Dynamic factors related to peace development there's also a very long term factor in the position and that is the pawn structure if you look closely white has a majority on the queen side three versus two and black has a majority on the king side four versus three so what black wants is to eventually start pushing his kingside Pawn so while white wants to push his Queen side Pawns now let's look at how the battle develops The Rook comes to D1 and if he gets Rook d8 he's already winning the game so Arjun needs to stop it at all costs so King E7 looks like the most logical move he brings his King up for Nils now to break through it's not so clear how he does it because his Bishop is well placed his Rook is here but there are no entry points also the Knight could come to E5 but where next so he he makes a small little waiting move here and places his spawn on B3 now in in a way it's an improving move because later on you can play a pawn up to C4 King B2 King C3 and you can see Arjun looking in the distance and playing his Knight to D6 one of the things that Arjun does a lot is he thinks without looking at the board and I think that helps him to focus even better Bishop goes back to D3 Nils wants to keep the bishop and now Arjun says I want to complete my development with B6 winning this Pawn on H7 looks slightly risky as your Bishop could get trapped with G6 so Nils goes Knight to E5 looking at the weekend C6 Square and Arjun develops his Bishop completes his development and now the game is getting more and more interesting because of this imbalance in Pawn structure no longer is Nils ahead in development it's all about who makes the better use of their pawns Arjun says I need to push my central pawns so F6 makes complete sense the Knight doesn't have too many squares on F3 it would be taken if it goes to G4 it gets double attacked here with the bishop Knight C4 seems like the best option and now you know there are two ways to go about this you can be content with equality you can take take and play E5 this position is equal but Arjun is slightly more ambitious he goes Knight E4 and he tells Nils if you take I take I feel that this end game slightly favors me because my Bishop is superior to your knight and also my knight is attacking these two pawns here so you can't kick it away also if you play Rook F1 it's slightly passive so nil says I will attack your Rook this is slightly dubious decision here but he is going for activity now Arjun takes the pawn on F2 he's happy to do that and he attacks the bishop the bishop now chops off the pawn on H7 so the pawns are equal but now how do you continue as black your knight is slightly trapped here on F2 you need to get it out but Arjun first puts his Bishop on D5 and it's a good Central Square to put the bishop also white cannot bring back the bishop just yet because then the Knight takes it so Knight E3 makes a lot of sense and now we need to figure out how should Arjun play he goes Bishop E4 he's ready to trade Bishops and go into Knight plus Rook end game Nils takes on e4 and Knight takes E4 time has come once again to take stock what has happened now with G4 you will see that Arjun has made a lot of progress with the King side pawns he now has a past Pawn here which is a great news meanwhile Nils pawns could be slightly weak he goes now G6 and his idea is to cement his Knight with F5 but here white has a very powerful move and Nils after spending a lot of time and coming down to 13 minutes on the clock finds it he plays G5 fantastic move the point is if you take fg5 I can simply move my knight attack your knight and next move take it meanwhile the most natural Moon Knight F5 fails to Knight C4 because Knight is coming to E5 and attacking the G6 Pawn so you can see that Arjun is naturally worried and he took a lot of time on the clock and plays Rook h8 it is a little unfortunate that arjun's pawns which were all clumped together are now sort of broken up that does mean that these two pawns have become slightly weak but on the other hand his King is now coming into the game and he takes it King takes F6 with this what has happened is that he has an active Knight an active King an active rook and also a past Pawn Rook F1 check given the engine of course says the position is equal no problems for both sides they should agree to a draw very soon however over the board it's completely different King G7 and with a player like Arjun who is pressing for a win it can get quite stressful for his opponent Rook takes H4 is hanging and Nils has to do something about it he goes Rook F4 defends the pawn and also attacks arjun's Knight what does Arjun do here where does he move his Knight a few options are Knight going back to F6 Knight going back to C5 Knight going back to D6 or you could actually come ahead and put your knight on G3 and Arjun plays his Knight to G3 and makes a lot of sense because now this Knight is threatening a fourth year and at the same time wants to jump back to F5 to put even more pressure on the H4 Pawn Rook C4 played now the Nils wants to get his Rook to C7 and chop this Pawn once one of the pawn goes his pawns can start rolling and create a passer Arjun plays King F6 and here's the sort of interesting point if you go Rook beat the C7 I'll take this you will take here and it results in a race and maybe after Knight F5 it's white who is under some pressure and so Nils is very very keen to keep his H4 pawn and not exchange it for the pawn on A7 that's the reason why he plays Knight G4 Arjun brings his King forward attacks the Knight Knight comes back to E3 giving a check the King has to move once again perhaps King E5 is the move to be considered here yes he plays his King to E5 and now Nils goes again a check and he's offering Arjuna draw that if you come to F5 I am happy to draw the game but Arjun very calmly like he always does plays his King presses the clock King to D6 and now the threat is to win the H4 Pawn so the Knight has to once again move away and you can see Nils shaking his head slightly has just one minute left on the clock yes you are on move 37 but there is definite pressure now Knight comes back to E3 The Rook still defends the pawn on H4 Arjun makes a very nice move Knight F5 now if you take the Knight then you get black pawns together and these two pawns are very strong passers that's the reason why the White Knight went back to G2 and now it's trying to defend this Pawn so you can see while both black pieces are attacking white species are both passively positioned and Arjun brings his King back to the top of the board very very interesting and here's a very instructive line if you go Rook C7 I have G5 takes check King here and Rook G1 trapping the Knight so some tricks like these are always in the air Mills goes B4 and he's trying now to create his own passer very understandable I love arjun's next move Rook d8 he is cutting off the white king and maybe he wants to get Rook D4 at some point Knight comes to F4 attacking the G6 Pawn Nils playing very sharply now the G6 pawns need pawns Pawn needs to be defended it the King goes back and can we go Rook C6 well the problem with Rook C6 was that there was Knight D4 which attacks the rook and defends so Nils with his most C3 has actually stopped the knight from coming to D4 very very interesting move Rook goes to D7 just a very very useful move and I I like how Arjun played it because now there are no more threats of Rook C7 and he also has a trump card up his sleeve King B2 not a great move his point was that if you had gone Rook C6 here then he would have played 97 you can't take here because of King F5 so that was the point now King B2 is played Arjun chops off the pawn here it was important for nails to take and the variation could go King takes Rook takes G5 and now Rook to G4 King F5 and this is still a drop because white also starts to push his pawns however at this point he goes Rook C6 which is a mistake and Arjun finds a wonderful move the point now is that if you play Knight takes E6 there is 95 Knight C5 check I take here you take here and the Knight is trapped that was arjun's very key calculation that he had made and so Nils can no longer take the pawn he go even if he takes here there is King F5 he goes A5 he pushes his Pawn forward and Arjun now knows that he's totally winning this he first goes Knight E5 excellent move still not afraid of Rook takes E6 if you go Rook C8 it's still losing this position you can start pushing your kingside pawns or you can take here you can bring your king up so he takes on E6 however this is an admission of defeat because after King F5 it's a clear double attack you hit the Knight you hit the rook and how do you protect both the things and the problem for white is that the Rook doesn't even have good squares to go to so it takes on E5 and Arjun has kind of calculated this all King takes E5 materially white is still doing okay if the Knight wasn't sort of trapped here uh this would have been fine however after King F5 you can see it that if this Knight doesn't have too many squares to go to if it goes here it's kind of uh Rook f seven traps it so Knight H4 and now two squares away from night is generally a good place for the king the Knight cannot check it the Knight cannot go to these squares he takes on B6 and now Arjun takes back so if somehow you could magically get the Knight here the position would be fine but the Knight is so far away it's not never going to reach back to its king So Nils Thrice his last attempt which is to bring in his King and try to win this Pawn but arjun's next move is so accurate the king takes away both these squares and now the Rook takes away the other two squares King C4 and The Rook comes out to G4 attacking the Knight King comes up and Nils is hoping that he has some counter play here but after Rook takes H4 King takes B6 the final accurate move is going to seal the deal and that is kingly Phi because even if you go B5 I can go Rook C4 King here and Rook take C3 P6 King C6 king is too close and the pawn is not going to Queen so Arjun here with the last move that is going to play place King D5 and this is all over he has played such a wonderful end game and has managed to outplay his opponent Nils with a wonderful smile on resignation such a thorough gentleman but Arjun has played his best chess and has managed to outwit his opponent now he just needs half a point tomorrow with the white pieces to advance to

Karu the English opening what is Prague going to respond with he plays his night out to F6 Knight comes out to C3 and now E5 Knight to F3 and we have the Four Knights G3 played by Hikaru Prague gets his Bishop to B4 Hikaru pauses for a bit tries to think what is the line he wants to play goes for Knight to D5 many moves are possible here but the sharpest of them is to push the pawn to E4 truck plays it of course he's very well prepared here Knight H4 he castles it out Bishop comes to G2 and pawn to D6 now notice how the bishop has controlled this Square so you want to trap the Knight with G5 Hikaru simply ignores it takes a moment thinks a bit and plays G5 now the night strap look at hikaru's expression he's like I know this now the only move here for white is D4 but Hikaru blunders with A3 this is a big mistake Bishop A5 and now suddenly Prague is winning D3 played and now the point is if you take here then Hikaru wants to get Bishop G5 and he's completely winning but Prague plays the best move C takes D5 and Hikaru must recapture he takes back Knight p8 and now the Knight is trapped Hikaru is completely lost here he's just lost a piece he takes on e4 G takes H4 Bishop H6 played very quickly Hikaru trying to show Prague that he's still an in control in this position but Prague is of course aware that this position is totally better for him G takes H4 and now the queen takes the pawn Queen C1 maybe some ideas of Bishop G5 if you count the number of Pawns white has only one Pawn for a piece and also this bishop will sit beautifully on B6 to defend C7 and look at this long diagonal Hikaru plays his King to H1 so that he can get his Rook down to G1 Prague develops his Knight the Knight will be well placed on E5 Bishop comes to F4 time is nikaru's favor he has 14 minutes 49 seconds while Prague has only 7 Minutes 57 seconds he gets his Knight to E5 Bishop G3 Queen H5 and now Rook to G1 the point is The Rook is trying to put pressure here but now the file is closed with Knight G6 F4 well it's not so easy to beat Hikaru in any position he's one of the best defenders in the world of Chess but pragnananda plays his Bishop back to B6 and now the G1 Rook is hanging so E3 played and you have to be careful about these this attack here so he plays his King to F7 Hikaru pushes his Pawn to E5 he's getting a bit desperate there because Prague had everything under control so he tries to open up the position but after takes takes now the Knight can simply chop off the pond he takes it Knight takes on E5 and now Hikaru does not even have a pawn here for a piece he's a complete piece down and and he doesn't even have a threat here because Bishop takes E5 can be met with Queen E5 or rookie 5 so everything is completely fine Prague now goes Bishop H3 it's very logical when you are ahead in material you want to trade pieces and that's what he does with Bishop H3 Hikaru brings his Rook into the game and he's trying to look at the F6 Square he takes Rook takes maybe if you can double here and put pressure but Prague nips that idea into the bud he puts his Knight here cannot come to F to The Rook the E3 Pawn is under pressure from all ends another Pawn is sacrificed Prague simply chops it off and now maybe this Rook can get activated from here Hikaru gives a check but the pawn will simply advance and block the queen and you can see that Hikaru is definitely upset with himself the opening mistake that he played has led him to a position where there is no chance of making a comeback Queen A4 played maybe he wants to give some checks here in Prague has three minutes on the clock he goes rookie for good move Queen comes back to D1 and now you take the pawn on E3 so Prague is now a piece and a pawn up in fact a piece and two pawns up Hikaru pushes his Pawn to A4 but he knows that these moves are futile now there's nothing much left but sometimes it's good to continue playing so that you can come out of that feeling that you haven't played well and get ready for the next game Queen B3 played attacking the B7 Pawn also looking in this diagonal his Pawn to B6 and asks Hikaru where's your next move coming from he goes Queen to B5 and now there are many many moves one of them is Bishop D4 to get the Knight to E3 to Fork these two Rooks whenever you give a check I have rookie seven to block so there's no real threat there and Prague plays Bishop D4 Hikaru resigns and tells Prague that the opening move was the main problem you know he forgot his opening there and uh that's how we won let's have a look at what mistake Hikaru made in the opening in this position pragnananda played the move G5 and this is a well-known position in fact karwana has played it twice with white kramnik has also played it with black we have had 11 aronian playing it Vincent kaimar and so on the only move for white to be in the game here is D4 and the move is very subtle now you would understand that you can't take the Knight because the moment you take it Bishop G5 is completely winning for white so the main defense here is to take Pawn takes now you save your knight go back to B8 now the pawn is defended here by the queen so next move you want to pick up the Knight however white has a very powerful move at his disposal here and that is Queen A4 and you will see that the bishop is trapped here it cannot go back anywhere and the game uh is in White's favor so that's the reason why if D4 is played the only good move for black is to play H6 here and the position is still very very complicated it can go on something like Knight E3 G takes H4 A3 Bishop A5 B4 H3 Bishop H1 and now you trap this bishop with C5 with a complicated but equal position also notice that after G5 what does not work is the mode D3 because if you play a pawn to D3 then I can take take and play Knight B8 and the same idea with Queen A4 Now doesn't work because the bishop does have the C5 Square the pawn is not on D4 in the game what Hikaru did was he just played the move A3 and this made it impossible for him that later on whenever when Prague did this this and Knight B8 there is now no point of Queen A4 because the bishop simply drops back and the Knight is trapped so the move A3 led to Hikaru losing the game the only move for him in this moment was D4 but he had forgotten about this line at that point or had simply mixed up his preparation

Kb3 1-0", "output": "welcome everyone to Arjun arigaisi taking on Java kheer cindaro this is their second classical game the first one ended in a draw where Arjun was pressing throughout but now Arjun has the white pieces and he starts off with Pawn up to E4 javakir plays E5 now just notice how Arjun makes his move and presses the clock and how Java Kira does it you know he plays naturally and he Taps the clock a little hard Arjun does it so softly it's the rui Lopez On The Board Bishop to B5 javo kid attacks the bishop and Arjun plays it back to A4 now Knight comes out to F6 hitting the pawn on e4 Arjun goes for the main line with short castle and now javokir plays the sharp open rui Lopez taking the pawn and Arjun thinks for a bit you can see him looking in the distance that is a very very natural way for Arjun to think whenever he's deep in calculation he tries to look away from the board he's thinking blindfolded and he plays his Pawn up to D4 now Java kills open Roy Lopez small surprise for Arjun there and that's the reason why he took a bit of time Bishop B3 and now Pawn up to D5 this is all well-known Theory and now white generally picks up the pawn on E5 Arjun thinks for a bit to see if there are any Sidelines he wants to go for no he goes for the main line now attacking the pawn on B5 so the bishop comes out and defends itself defends the pawn and now many moves exist you can go C3 Knight D2 these are the main moves also there's Bishop E3 and Arjun wants to be sure that the line he plays gives him good winning Chances with the white pieces so he goes Knight BD to challenging the knight in the center has a few options here he goes for the Knight C5 move now it's interesting in normal Rue Lopez you don't want to give up this bishop but here you are fine because if black takes you can take with the Knight looking at these important squares so cindaro just develops his Bishop to E7 and now the bishop goes to C2 looking at this beautiful long diagonal D4 plate Arjun plays his Knight to B3 now there are two main moves in this position one is to push forward other is to take javokir place the more ambitious move D3 now this Pawn can become a strength as well as a weakness it can become anything Pawn takes for the time being the pawn is hanging with the bishop and the queen but cindero gets his Bishop to F5 and defends the pawn Arjun now has to decide what to do because Java care is blitzing out his moves he's at 1 hour 36 minutes and so Arjun is taking his time and he goes for the move B4 this is still not a novelty it has been played before and I'm sure that joker cindaro is still in his preparation so he takes a bit of think here generally if cindero is well prepared he simply blitzes out his moves but here he takes around five minutes on the clock and he castles who is planning to Castle but he will Castle I believe yes he castles it out for Arjun to attack the pawn on D3 is not a simple thing he can go rookie one rookie 3 but then black can meanwhile also come Queen D7 Rook d8 so he goes first Bishop F4 developing his Bishop now notice that with the move B4 what Arjun has done is that he's fixed the pawn on A6 as a weakness and that could hurt jawakir in the long run while the Bishop is kind of passive because the of the Pawn on D3 The Rook is active on the a file how does black continue in this position maybe Queen D7 connecting the Rooks he seems like the best idea of goes Queen D7 plays it Aro is one of the biggest talents of Uzbek chess and he is you know taking chess very seriously H3 still following some of the top games Fabiano versus mama diaro is one of them also vishianan that's played this position with black pieces is here at this tournament with uh wakidov who is his trainer and second and also he helped ding leren in his world championship match by the way G4 played here by Arjun hitting the bishop now taking year does not make sense because the bishop simply drops back and white is winning so that's the reason why you have to move the bishop away now one could really argue here as to what is Arjun actually achieving by playing these moves doesn't it just weaken his King well the point is that these pawns actually limit Black's pieces and at some point if Arjun gets Bishop G3 and Knight H4 he can actually eliminate this all-important bishop so Bishop G3 is an excellent move now cindero should think about playing his Pawn up to A5 it's a good move you can get rid of the weakness on A6 Square and in general it's a good idea to play that way but there's also some other possibilities like King h8 with the idea of perhaps F6 later on for example if you play F6 right now E6 is very powerful and you can't take here because Bishop A2 and it pins the queen to the king so that's the reason why cindarov plays King a cheat and he tells Arjun that now my threat is F6 because no longer E6 would be powerful it's a very subtle move but it seems to be working um and Arjun who is still at 134 while cindaro has gone down to 55 minutes is still looking in the distance this is dangerous yes when Arjun looks in the distance he still is in his prep Rook E1 and now this Rook has come here so that when F6 is played you still go E6 with the control of the Rook behind the pawn that's the idea now cindarov has to still think of one way forward A5 does look look like a decent option he goes Queen to C8 the queen drops back on C8 and it has to be assessed now how white proceeds so one way is to go rookie 3 trying to attack this Pawn which is logical but black will play A5 and try to create play on the other side you will see that Arjun here thinks for a very long time and the best move here is Knight H4 because then you are planning to take this bishop and if you take on H4 then I can take back with my Bishop and this is a good position so will Arjun find that and while we are looking at this some sort of a time lapse you can see Arjun is hardly looking at the board he is looking here and there looking in the distance and finally he's ready to make his move and he plays Knight to H4 very logical move and with the Knight coming out here he wants to attack the bishop on G6 so cindaro doesn't really want to lose this bishop right because if you lose it then the pawn on D3 is very very weak so that's the reason why he chops off the Knight and now Arjun must recapture but with that he will be attacking The Rook so in a way you can imagine that cindaro comes well prepared to the game stored as Arjun they play some 18 19 moves of theory and then now on mood 22 Arjun already has got a substantial Edge which can mean that cindero's prep has not been up to the mark The Rook is attacked and he plays D2 and he's hoping that this Pawn remains on the board but even if it goes away like he has to lose this then the E5 Pawn can be taken Now The Rook is hanging so it has to be protected Rook comes out to D5 and Arjun has a few options now firstly he can go Bishop A2 and move the Rook away because let's imagine if you go here take I can go Queen D2 with a very good position my Rook is coming in the other option is that you don't move your Bishop away and you actually Trade It and this is something which Arjun is thinking about whether he should take on G6 or not and he decides to chop off the bishop which is a good move he takes it here two ways to recapture you can take with the edge pawn and the F Pawn I guess taking with the F Pawn is slightly more risky so indaro captures towards the center and plays H takes G6 his King is safe on h8 now Arjun here takes the pawn on D2 and a very logical move if you were to play Rook takes E5 then Bishop would drop back and somehow this battery of the rook and queen is quite dangerous so first in the road takes on D2 Arjun recaptures and now his point was that he wants to take the pawn on E5 to restore the material balance taking on E5 has happened and think carefully now the Knight is coming to F3 to give a check the queen can actually move to B7 so for Arjun the next move is Pretty Natural he puts his Queen on D5 centrally posted hitting the Knight looking at the rook and overall a good move for white now what does black do here black decides to play his Queen to E8 and now here is the moment where Arjun has to think a bit what are the possibilities for him you see one possibility is rookie one but that is absolutely a blunder because of the check you will lose the Rook so you can't do that you may want to actually prepare it with King G2 but then black has Knight to C4 which is a very very useful move so Arjun starts to think at this moment when he has one hour on the clock so he has a lot of time he's 32 moves ahead on the clock but now if you look at rookie one does not work you may think let's go Bishop G3 attacking here but once again the Knight comes and attacks the B2 pawn and it's not very comfortable because if you play B3 suddenly The Rook comes in and then the Knight comes to D2 attacking B3 trying to come to F3 so there are problems the right move here and the best move is actually Queen E4 and it's a very interesting move because if you go Knight C4 I want to take take and already your Pawn is hanging on A6 but if you don't play it and you try and let's say save your knight this way now I can go Bishop G3 and put pressure here I'm anyway threatening to exchange the queens and take on A6 so Queen E4 is not a tall and easy move in fact arjun's mind could be attracted by the mo F4 because here after Knight C4 there is the muruki one and it keeps White's Advantage intact but look at arjun's time from one hour he has come down to 24 minutes 23 in fact and now 22 he plays F4 this is just unbelievable and cindaro instantly was ready with his response of G5 he did not even consider Knight C4 now if Arjun were to capture here then after GH4 and next murug B8 black should be fine if you take on G5 year with the bishop then perhaps after Knight C4 there is no rookie one and with Queen coming in this does look very dangerous so Arjun places Rook to E1 and his point is that if you take here now on H4 my Rook enters and with these two centralized pieces and Rook coming to H5 you are in big trouble so cindero finds another good movie plays C6 forcing Arjun to take on E5 and now we are going into an end game Queen takes now you can take with the Rook you can also take with the pawn taking with the Rook means The Rook will be then activated down to the seventh rank or to the fifth uh rank or seven uh here but he plays Pawn takes and now after GTX H4 what Arjun wants to do is he wants to maybe put his Rook on A1 that seems to be his idea he goes to K1 and in the background we have Magnus Carlson who just came and looked at the game now with Rook A1 Arjun is putting pressure here the best move for black is Rook B8 activate the Rook if you win this come down here if you win this take the B2 Pawn yes you are Pawn down but your Rook is active this Pawn is weak the king is cut off completely this should end in a draw so cindero should definitely consider activating his Rook to d8 it is the best move in the position but he in fact goes for he's touching his roof see he puts his Rook on C and this is kind of the first inaccuracy here but it's still fine cindero's idea is that if you take your Arjun I want to play C5 so yes after Rook takes A6 he wants to play C5 get rid of his weakness and then after B Tech C5 which Arjun will most likely play he will take with the rook and then attack the E5 Pawn and cindaro has only 4 minutes left on the clock Arjun has 20 we are on move 34 so he takes on C5 and now attacking this Pawn so well Arjun may be the best way to continue is push his Pawn trade it yes he does pushes his pawn and now after the trade F takes E6 Rook takes E6 the problem is Rook D5 is an extremely strong move and now the Rook is coming in here or here and then check and attacking this Pawn or even to D3 to attack H3 and the position is equal so Arjun is completely um you know fine but also cindero is totally okay the game would most likely end in a draw if zindaro finds this murugani fight but he blunders with P4 that's a big mistake because yes cindero did calculate that after Rook C2 he has great play by cutting the king off and B2 is hanging but what he missed is this simple retreating move by Arjun and this on move 37 white has got now close to decisive Advantage let's try to understand why this is decisive mainly because after Arjun takes back with the pawn white will be a pawn up secondly The Rook is ideally located on E3 defending the C3 pawn and the H3 pawn and thirdly the King has not been cut off on the last rank here which means that you can actually activate your king which is one of the most important things in the end game and that is exactly what Arjun does he brings his King up to F2 and now cindero in big trouble because what Arjun does is Kings E2 maybe King D3 pushed the pawn to C4 and this Rook on E3 also cuts off the black king from coming into the game now Arjun plays his King up to E2 very useful and if Cinder over to go King G5 we are trying to enter Then Rook F3 is a powerful move cutting the king off so he goes King F6 and now Arjun can play his King to D3 with the idea of C4 C5 he goes King D3 and while this position is slightly tricky still Arjun is doing it nicely now Rook D5 check we have crossed 40th moves so both players have enough time the king comes up to C4 what's in the Rope essentially has to do is go to d8 yes and now his point is Arjun if you go King B5 I'll give you a check if you go King A6 I'll come back and you won't be able to push your Pawn easily and if you come further ahead I'll come here somehow it's not so easy to push the pawn so Arjun goes here King C5 and this is very interesting the way in which Arjun is doing this notice how he manages to create the play first goes King D5 now every Pawn push that happens it takes away the space from the black Rook on the last rank to give checks here and so on so cindaro doesn't want the pawn to push so that's the reason why he gives a check and now Arjun plays his King up to C6 and you would be wondering what is Arjun doing here well the thing is that now once again his plan is C4 so you must give a check right you that's what cindero wants to do he gives a check and now Arjun if he plays King D6 here that is a very smart move which most likely does no he goes King D7 okay very interesting so his point here is that Rook is attacked you have to move to C4 and now after the next move King to D6 white has a check here and also the idea is to go King D5 and then C4 C5 this is the plan frico's Rook A4 Rook goes to A4 and now cindarov says that if you go King D5 I will still either pin you or I'll give you some checks that is his idea but can Arjun simply give this check which is very important whenever the two kings are separated by one file you give a check to cut the king off and now the King has to move away so now the black king is cut off now there are few ways to think about this position one way is that you want to push this Pawn ahead which is what Arjun wants after King D5 but the other point to note is that white can actually give a check King moves back and then go Rook catch 5 and win the pawn on H4 so he goes Rook A3 here attacking this Pawn Rook F5 check now the king moves back and this is the key moment now this is what Arjun had actually thought of King D4 and his point is he doesn't want to even touch this Pawn check he will not move the pawn up because then Rook comes down and maybe attacks here and it gets into some kind of a race what he's going to do is he's going to just drop his King back to D3 you can see Arjun just making sure all the calculations are correct and if you were to go Rook A1 with the idea of Rook H1 to attack here I go Rook H4 a rook H5 to catch one and I take this and I'm two pawns up so Arjun has done this very clinically you know this entire thing A8 and now Rook H5 Rook H4 is hanging you can see Java kids indaro already feels like he has lost this game Rook H5 he will be two pawns down and that position will be Beyond salvation King F6 take the pawn seems logical Arjun is now two pawns up well cindarov tries to push his pawn and hopes that this Pawn can limit two of white spawns but that's not going to be the case Rook H7 by Arjun cutting the king off by the rank on the seventh rank now the black king cannot move backwards so gives a check the king will most likely move back and once Arjun has finished his expedition with the Rook taking this Pawn it's now time to push the C Pawn King E5 played now pushing the C Pawn would not be a good idea because of King D4 and attacking here but instead he goes Rook F7 King E4 and what he wants to do now is play Rook to F5 very good move taking this Pawn so even though cindero might get the edge Pawn he will be two points down takes here Rook takes H3 and this two pawns is a easy win uh you can go King B3 you can move your Rook King B3 the idea is King B4 C4 C5 you just go step by step cindaro resigns and Arjun has one and immediately after the game Arjun says that instead of B4 you should have gone Rook D5 here and that would have been a draw well I'll leave you with the analysis of these young young talents but suffice it to say Arjun played a very nice game foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess

perhaps one of the strongest players ever in the history of Chess not to have become a world champion Ivan chuk starts the clock well they had already shook hands when they had met and sat at the board so no handshake Magnus adjusts his pieces and it will be very exciting to see what Magnus does he plays his Pawn up to D4 anyone took now decides to go D5 evanchook is one of those players who can play just about any opening and you know he's very well versed with all sorts of systems Knight F3 played by Carlson and Ivan trook can go for C6 E6 Knight F6 many many possibilities there's definitely some logic behind Magnus playing Knight F3 first and not C4 but we are not aware of what he's thinking E6 played by ivanchuk a flexible move maybe at some point you might want to try for this triangle system and stone wall without developing your knight Pawn up to C4 by Magnus evanchook has played amazingly well in this tournament and for his age he is doing some amazing feats in this tournament Knight comes out to F6 and will Magnus play his favorite Catalan or will he go Knight C3 these are essentially the two main moves he goes for G3 the Catalan and now ivankuk has to choose from many options that he has he can take the pawn he can play Bishop E7 or he can even give this check he decides to give the check on B4 and it's generally an idea where you provoke white to block and then just drop your Bishop back that's how the the plan continues Bishop D2 played by Magnus and ivanchuk places his Bishop back and tells Magnus that hey this is not the most ideal Square for your Bishop so you would anyway have to move it later so I don't lose a tempo also this is a very solid system once you play this you are intending to play solidly not to take on C4 but rather play C6 B6 Bishop B7 Knight D7 and so on and there you see Ivan took bolstering his center with the move C6 Magnus plays his Queen to C2 this is a good spot for the queen you know it's active and uh generally very very useful uh it also defends C4 Ivan chook plays his Knight to D7 and Magnus can Castle here that is one of the main lines also there is Bishop F4 he goes Bishop F4 and well somewhere it feels like Magnus doesn't want to Castle too soon he has some ideas in mind and there's a very interesting move that Magnus has played in such positions after black castles here which iwanchuk does and let's see if Magnus plays it he has already played it with sarana as well as Ding leren and that move is H4 here uh let because you know it's a very interesting move Magnus plays it the idea of this move is to perhaps gain some space on the king side also not to Castle too soon and some points you have your Bishop that can move to G5 but you can see ivankuk plays d-tech C4 pretty quickly and he seems to be well prepared against H4 because Magnus has already played it Queen takes C4 and in modern day chess H4 has become a very common stay in many positions so now Knight D5 and imagine if the pawn wasn't on H4 you would have to drop your Bishop back to D2 but now with the pawn here you have an additional option of offering a trade of Bishops that's exactly what Magnus does and this is the main point of one of the main points of playing H4 still in his prep it seems blazes spawn up to H6 and this is very good preparation by ivankuk because if you could guess that Magnus was going to play this line you already have neutralized this opening because black is roundabout even here now one of the moves in this position is short Castle the other move is Knight to C3 white plays Pawn to E4 and Magnus is a little bit over ambitious I would say with this move because he is having his King still in the center his pieces are a little underdeveloped but he wants to make sure that black does not get the C5 and E5 brakes so Knight P6 played by ivanchu hitting the queen and next move if he can play C5 that would be really really strong already he has equalized out of the opening where can Magnus play his Queen is the question do you play here here he goes to C3 and now C5 makes so much sense because you are hitting the center however there is a very nice move here which is to play E5 it's a pawn sack evanchook has one hour 27 minutes he has to figure out if this works because if you take Pawn takes oh he takes 12 minutes and finds it the point is if you take here the Knight jumps and hits the queen if you play Queen B3 my knight comes here and then there is trouble and if you go Queen C2 there is Queen before check and because of all these variations Magnus said I'm castling it out buddy one chook you can see he came back he wrote his score sheet while standing up he knows that he's equalized in this position very comfortably Magnus has not gotten any opening advantage and that is already good news for ivanchu he takes on D4 and Magnus will most likely tick with the queen or it's also possible to take with the Knight both moves make a lot of sense you can see Magnus taking his time he's definitely not very happy with the way the opening has gone and Ivan choked with all his understanding and knowledge of Chess has managed to equalize here now you you can put your knight on C5 this is a great Square for the night hitting E4 Pawn preparing Rook d8 it's an amazing move uh also possible is Knight F6 to put pressure there Ivan chuk does play his Knight to sifa and I love how he plays his pieces so slowly but places them on the right in the center of the squares and now magnus's E4 Pawn is hanging so if you go to take time to do this then already Ivan chuk is hitting on the D3 square but Magnus goes Rook C1 and he tells you want to take this Pawn be my guest because then I'll pin you and if you try to save it I'll Attack you again but this is not so bad in fact after Rook d8 black should be completely fine and Evancho should have gone for this I believe he goes Knight A6 and perhaps somewhere in his mind he wants to get the Knight to E6 and that could be one of his ideas and lovely move by Magnus Knight bd2 this is something we all have to learn from Magnus like the most natural move seems Knight on C3 but this Knight is a bit dominated there so you put your knight on D2 you bolster the other night and when Ivan chuk plays Bishop G4 and I think it's a logical move the bishop is well placed you also when you put your knight on E6 you don't want your Bishop to be blocked in inside so you play your Bishop here Magnus now plays Bishop F1 he sees that the bishop doesn't really have scope on this diagonal and he doesn't want to push the pawn just as yet so he's activating the Bishop from here Ivan shook now plays his Rook to d8 hitting the queen and also this move Bishop F1 comes in very handy to control the D3 Square as you will notice now with Ivan chuk's Rook he's not only attacking the queen he's also looking at the D3 Square so when Magnus will move his Queen here uh Ivan took could have gotten his Knight and tried to come in with night before and so on so Queen E3 played by Magnus and now you will notice the usefulness of Bishop F1 move if you go Knight B4 there's already A3 and the Knight cannot enter these quests so we one chook now doesn't want you know his structure to be completely ruined so perhaps Knight C7 makes a lot of sense here he plays Knight C7 and Magnus goes Pawn to A4 Ivan took places his Knight to C8 I really like magnus's A4 move because he's gaining space you saw him the opening he played H4 now he's playing A4 A5 and trying to clamp down the blacks Queen side and evanchook makes a positional error a big mistake here he should have maybe played rook f8 and the position is still very balanced but now when he takes Knight takes you realize that the position is getting a bit stressful here Black Knights are not playing White's Bishop does look a bit passive right now but Magnus has some Grand plans for it you will get to see in a bit and after A6 Rook A4 is played here by Magnus Magnus has got his Rook here beautifully positioned this is a great Rook lift ivankuk plays his Rook F to E8 and he is putting pressure on the E4 Pawn E5 and this is where magnus's Brilliance comes to light he's giving up this square but in return he wants to place his Bishop here get his Queen here and start an attack also The Rook can swing over to G4 if needed brilliant brilliant play and excellent understanding of the various positional nuances the Knight comes in and attacks the Queen the queen moves to the side and puts pressure on the B7 Pawn so if you see the a pawn has clamped down the king side and the H Pawn hopes to do the same on the king side Knight A7 played by iwanchu he wants to play his Knight to B5 and magnus's plan is very clear get the bishop to D3 put it back to B1 Queen C2 launch an attack there yes he plays his Bishop to D3 now for Evancho very important to meet it prophylactically like here Goa E6 Queen C2 Knight f8 and you are fine but instead he makes an error he goes after Bishop D3 Knight to B5 and now there's no time because Bishop B1 excellent move by Magnus how do you meet the small Queen C2 there's no time for this Knight to reach f8 Square here so he needs to actually if he goes G6 there will be H5 so E1 chook has to make this very unfavorable move H5 just so that he can meet Queen C2 with G6 that is his point but Magnus now plays rookie one he realizes that when he goes Queen C2 and E1 took place G6 he wants to get the E6 break in that would just destroy Black's position so ivanta goes and plans to put his Knight on E6 so that after G6 is entire structure is very well placed what does Magnus do now he plays his Queen to C2 threatening a check on at seven he want to quickly place his Pawn up to G6 and now there is a rash move which is G4 takes Rook takes and then you want to blast open the king side will Magnus play it you know there are some moves you say it's not in magnus's style but Magnus really has no style he's a universal player and he may play it but he goes Bishop A2 very logical King G7 and now G4 definitely makes sense or do you want to sack a pawn with E6 but then there is F5 so Magnus goes Knight G5 again a great move looking at the E6 square and now E12 can no longer get his Knight there Rook f8 played by Ivan chook he's defending his F7 Pawn how should Magnus continue this attack oh he pushes the pawn in and the point is that if you play F5 which is very very logical the dark squares become weak so Queen could land back on C1 looking at these squares and the Knight could jump in Ivan took place only one square forward he plays his Pawn to F6 and asks magnus's Knight to leave as soon as possible and the Knight doesn't want to leave it says I'm on a good Square I don't want to go and so Bishop B1 fantastic move played by Magnus if you take the Knight there's a queen G6 Queen H5 is just falling apart and you can never put your queen in because even when I exchange the Queens there's E7 forking the two Rooks so that's the reason why F5 was played and now Queen C1 again looking at these darkened squares Knight F7 coming in Rook comes to D5 there are many many different ways in which Magnus can take advantage of this I still think Knight F7 is a fantastic move but also you can go Bishop A2 again Hit The Rook that is amazing you know the way in which Magnus has managed to outplay evanchuk positionally is amazing because you know when you look at uh players like Ivan chuk you would think that they might not be great at opening Theory or tactics but positional plays something that they would excel in with all their chess understanding but here's Magnus outplaying them by just pure little improving moves Queen E3 played the queen is well positioned the Knight comes to D5 attacking the queen where do you put your queen queen E5 check looks like an obvious move but maybe then the Knight drops back so Magnus would try to somehow break through he goes Queen to D2 he puts his Queen on a decent square and is angling at the king side dark squares Evancho goes Rook to F6 he's keeping an eye on this E6 Pawn but it's firmly uh protected also the knights don't really have great squares to go to so First Pawn comes to B4 hitting the Rook where can the Rook go is the question The Rook moves to C3 supported by both the knights but now you can just take Knight yes Bishop takes Pawn takes and and I guess you can take the pawn there right it's a free Pawn nothing is defending it black is attacking nothing his King side pieces are completely tied up and so might as well capture the pawn generally you don't want to take such pawns because you when you have a positional Advantage but here it is not reduced yes evanchuk wants to create counter play that's the reason why he plays F4 and he wants to open up the position with his Rooks looking here and this might be his last attempt to getting some counter play but Magnus is ready to ruin his structure he takes here and he tells you want to if you take this one then I give you a check if you go back I already have many different moves now this is a pin you don't like Rook D1 Rook D7 threatened so gf4 very bold move now you are two pawns up so evanchook has to decide now what to do taking the pawn is not great but then again it does look that white king is a bit exposed so he goes Rook to F5 and now Magnus can drop back his Queen to E4 and keep his two extra pawns evanchook does not have great scope in the position there are there's nothing much he can do the Knight on G5 is an absolute monster it controls all the important squares no Magnus plays his Queen back to E4 and evanchook is again I mean every move that Evancho has to make is not so easy because there are no real great moves that he has and Rook D1 is really a big threat the other route can actually enter The Fray very soon D2 and that should be game over so Ivan took there just moving his eyebrows there trying to figure out what to do and he resigns he gives in Magnus has played a beautiful positional game something that we all can learn from amazing chest there and Ivan troop such a great player but today it was Magnus all the way [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

the white pieces opens with one E4 Yan goes for his E5 customary line the Petra of Defense super solid and with the takes now in the first classical game with it did get an advantage with the white pieces facing Jan's Petrov but nepo has prepared this opening so well for his world championship matches that he's ready to give it another go we are in the mainline territory Bishop comes out both sides develop it's time to castle with it castles so does nepo and here the move that was played by with it last time in the first classical game was C4 he plays it once again C6 and queen C2 was played with H6 was Nepal's answer and here with it deviates with the move Rook E1 and nepo remembers his preparation goes Bishop to H5 look at the time on the clock for both the players 26 minutes for with it 26 minutes 18 seconds for nepo Queen comes out to C2 and now nepo takes a bit of time and goes Knight A6 now the Knight is angling to come to B4 so with it instantly stops it with a spawn coming up nepo now brings his Bishop back very solid in the center and with it decides to push this is a risky decision because somewhere you want to keep the tension but you've released it and nepo went to B8 so that his Knight could use the C7 square with it brings his Knight out now the pressure on e4 is quite a lot and lepo sort of fixes the knight in the center with the move F5 the Knight comes back with it is aiming at this Square to put his Knight it's also looking at the weakened E6 Square to fourth so Knight comes to C7 at least controlling the E6 square with it goes to Knight F4 Bishop E8 the idea could be to start pushing your king side pawns the Knight jumps into the center this is a very interesting position but look at the bay in which both sides are making their moves they are so well prepared this is already move number 17 with it goes 92 nepo brings his Knight out to E6 and now what does with it do can he push the Knight away yes he plays it and now nepo if he saves his Knight then he loses the game because his Pawn is hanging but that was never the intention he actually sacrifices a piece and goes Queen to F6 Now Pawn takes Pawn takes you can't really save the bishop it's trapped also there's a threat of Queen F2 and mate coming up so with it plays his Knight back attacks the queen and defends the square Queen moves away and with it gives up his Bishop because it was already trapped there on D3 fifth 25 minutes for with it 26 minutes for Yan he takes with the queen Queen takes it's actually a battle between two really prepared opponents who's going to Flinch first with it now thinking for a bit but he still looks like in his preparation because he still has 24 minutes and nepo is also in his prep he's moving to towards 27 minutes there and we are on Moon number 23 insane prep with it now takes the pawn allowing black to Fork nepo goes in and forks the pieces Bishop comes out and now you can take this Rook or you can take this one he takes on E1 and I think you must take back with the with the Rook he takes back with the idea of giving a check and the bishop coming here it could be a dangerous attack so nepo finds the best move he pushes his Pawn to H5 and now with it jumps in with the Knight giving a check so the thing is if the king comes up to G7 or at seven it's fine he finds it he plays King G7 because King h8 was a blunder it was Knight G5 followed by Bishop C3 so he plays King here Knight here if you take this 96 check is losing because there's a discovered check from the bishop so that's the reason why nepo finds King G6 now nepo is out of his prep so until move 28 with it was in his prep no he's also in his prep on mode 29 whoa with its preparation is unbelievable now there are some problems you still can't take here because of 96 check so nepo goes Bishop F4 the problem oh he gives a check now you can't interpose with the Rook because after take take Bishop F4 white is better so he has to actually take the Knight but what is with its idea after that he's on Moon number 30. he takes and with it is he still in his prep he still has 24 minutes easy two pieces down G3 what a move this is if Bishop takes H4 is a mate you can see their nepo a little bit worried is it made there is a move H4 which is perhaps the best but he goes for the second best move Bishop G6 and I think this is where with its prep kind of comes to an end Rook takes F4 and we reach a position which is round about even King takes H6 now and with it pushes the pawn forward he's a pawn up he's going to recover his PCR because it is pinned is ready to go into a king and pawn end game which is interesting but with it doesn't need to take instantly because anyway the king is pinned so he can actually move up he goes King F2 and now only move for black is to play King G5 but what a preparation that was from with the 30 plus moves while nepo was also prepared for move 27-28 by the way if you take here here this is a drawn King and pawn end game so with it takes with the pawn nepo takes back and I think if you want to try still for a win you need to play your Rook down to E7 with it plays is Rook to E7 lepo gives a check yes maybe you're going to lose a pawn as uh black but you will have enough activity because your king is well placed you have a pawn here your Rook can enter nepo now has to figure out what to do is losing his Pawn here on B7 so he goes Rook F5 cool move if you take here I want to take here if you take here I want to give a check and I want to win this Pawn which would be a draw so that's the reason why with it goes B4 nepo places Pawn up to B6 and now it's uh close to a draw because with it takes on A7 he takes on C5 therefore with it takes on B6 Pawn takes on B6 and maybe the right move now is rookie six yes he plays rookie six and the important point is that look F6 could be met with H4 which which is still a draw but he goes Rook D5 nepo is uh very confident about his position even if he loses a pawn check here now if you come up I'll give a check and pick up this Pawn so that's the reason why you may want to come down to the last rank so he goes King G1 Rook D1 check and now with it has to move maybe they can agree to a draw with Perpetual checks but I believe with it may want to try for a win he he could go King E3 but then this Rook takes H2 Rook B6 and check and you lose this Pawn with a draw so King F1 played and now nepo um plays Rook A2 that's a safe way to do it he will be still a pawn down but he will have it under control Rook takes A3 Rook goes to E6 and now Rook to B6 played Rook to B3 plane sorry the pawn is attacked with it comes back defends the pawn but nepo says look your Pawn's not going forward your king is anyway cut off here and I'm going to constantly give you checks so that's what he does and it's pretty clear that white cannot win this it's going to end in a draw and what an amazing game this was both players repeating now and I think they're going to accept a draw with it just making a final assessment of whether he has any chances goes up again they look at each other shake hands it's a draw unbelievable prep by both sides with it did test nepo but he was right up to the mark and the first game ends in a draw [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into

on pragnananda he has the black pieces in the first game and there are two good friends of each other but over the board they are going to go at each other's throats that is for sure Arjun does his ritual of focusing before the game just closing his eyes trying to get into the group but pragnananda comes with a banana there and he takes his chair he has this little white mark on his head called vibhuti that he puts he's writing down the score sheet he has the white pieces so small advantage and Arjun finally comes out of his meditative pose shakes hands both of them have this small smile on their face and off we go Prague has the white pieces and how does he open now he can play E4 he can play D4 but he goes for Knight F3 brings his Knight out and Arjun plays his Pawn up to D5 this is going to be an exciting opening Clash both of them very well prepared opponents so what are the new ideas they've brought on to the table G3 Arjun goes G6 and Prague places Bishop to G2 this is known as the ready opening Bishop G7 Arjun has chosen quite a solid system against it and Prague now transposes it into a D4 opening by pushing his Pawn to the center Arjun brings his Knight out Prague simply castles here it's a completely symmetrical position and this is known as a very solid line for black you know after after generally white plays C4 here you want to go C6 that's exactly what Prague does he goes C4 the couple of ways to play one is to take the pawn the other one is C6 this is a this is a good move and this is a solid system so Prague goes for this queen A4 move now this is played quite a bit and has been seen at top level and that's the reason why Arjun brings his Knight back to D7 he knows it his idea is to play his Knight to B6 attack the queen and the pawn to sort of resolve the tension in the center so Prague Place Queen B3 and this has been not played much at all maybe two three games and that's the reason why Arjun thinks for nearly five minutes and pushes his Pawn to A4 interesting move because if you take on D5 it seems like you're going to win a pawn here however Arjun has this inter mezzo after taking here which prank does he's going to play this intermediate Pawn push the queen is attacked the queen has to move and if you go to C4 there is always Knight B6 so he goes Queen D1 and now Arjun takes back his Pawn so the center is now equalized but Prague is saying to Arjun that look I'm attacking your A4 Pawn and also I'm attacking your D5 Pawn so with this Prague wants to claim a small Edge Knight to B6 good move by Arjun defending the A4 and D5 Pawns Bishop comes out to F4 that is a good Square for the bishop and also prague's time is 1 hour 32 minutes while Arjun is down to 1 hour 15 minutes you can say that the preparation battle between these two players has definitely been won by Prague although the position is not really so dangerous Rook C1 Prague still blitzing out his moves and Arjun now needs to decide what to do with his Bishop he says I'll think about the bishop later let me first play my Rook to A5 very interesting move B3 played by Prague he is trying to sort of get rid of that A4 Pawn which was clamping him down perhaps 8X B3 and now you can take with the queen or the pawn that's what drug is deciding here and after quite some thought he takes back with the pawn so let's take stock of the situation it looks round about even but is Knight on B6 is not well placed it is dominated by that pawn on B3 Black Goes Bishop G4 putting pressure on the Knight and now white plays his Knight to E5 a very very good move and now the bishop is hanging so if you take here I'll take back with the pawn attacking the Central Pawn here so he goes Bishop E6 back Queen comes up to D2 and I maybe take stakes and The Rook on A5 slightly weakened but definitely having a small pull here what is arjun's next move going to be he goes Queen A8 and here Prague could go H4 H5 with this typical plant but he goes a little passive he plays his Pawn up to E3 and Arjun brings his Rook to CH so both players just getting their pieces into the game Prague now brings the Knight back to D3 He wants to plant it on C5 which is an excellent Square for the night but Arjun now finds a very very pretty move he goes Bishop F5 and I like it because now Knight C5 is impossible because of this move E5 hitting here and the Knight is slightly loose so Prague goes H3 but now arjun's main problem in this position was this bishop it was not getting good squares to go to and he can take on D3 and he can sort of harmonize his position if you look this bishop is gone Queen takes and he can now put his Pawn up to E6 and that just connects everything that's what he does so even though white has the bishop pair now black has a comfortable position he goes Rook fd1 and let's see how Arjun continues he quickly brings his Bishop to f8 because the bishop was doing not much on this diagonal he brings his Bishop here maybe it could come in handy on that on those squares both players down to 25 minutes on the clock and they still have to make 17 moves to reach move 40 well get 30 minutes extra night before played hitting the queen and now Prague needs to decide where to move his Queen he goes Queen E2 the queen is well placed on this Square and for Arjun now the next plan could be to attack the B3 Pawn which he does with Rook K3 now you need to defend this Pawn you cannot move your Rook because the Knight is hanging so you have to play the Queen and with this queen you defend the pawn how do you make inroads into the position Arjun shows the way he first plays Knight A2 and now this Knight will be traded and then pregnant by mistake touching his King and Arjun is like that's completely fine no problem Knight takes A2 Rook takes A2 played here hitting the Queen the queen is actually kind of out of squares Queen B1 is possible but there's also an intermediate Rook exchange when if you take on B2 there is Rook A8 98 and Rook A1 where white is pushing so he goes Knight C8 and I think Arjun is very happy with this move Knight C8 the reason is his Knight was doing not much on B6 and now it has some good ideas with 97 Knight F5 and stuff like that so Queen C3 played and yes Knight goes to E7 now either you put your knight on C6 to control these quests or you put your knight on F5 Prague goes B4 and he tells Arjun C6 is not your Square because then I'll push B5 and your knight has to move again so that's the reason why Arjun goes Knight F5 other direction and his plan is that when your opponent has the bishop pair exchange one of them so Bishop D6 is a very very good move so Arjun plays Bishop D6 now Prague should realize that he is a you know not so doing not so well play G4 Knight cannot move Bishop hangs you take I take you go back I take take and then maybe just B5 Queen C8 coming opposite colored Bishops it should end in a draw this position however instead of going G4 Prague is thinking for his move he's down to 5 minutes 26 seconds he has to make 10 more moves and he plays Bishop E5 maybe the first real inaccuracy here by Prague because now Arjun can actually take this bishop yes he takes good move Pawn takes and then plays King up to G7 and the upside of this is that if you look at the quality of the black pieces Knight is beautifully placed here Rook is fantastic the queen can somehow if it enters the game that would be amazing he goes B5 and Arjun brings his Queen to d8 now so a queen has come in and wants to come to the G5 Square Prague needs to find some counter play and I think Prague has a great idea he plays Queen before this is excellent because now if Queen G5 the game can simply flip because Rook C8 and there's mating attack here so Arjun finds this excellent Pawn push D4 and the point is if you take here I can take with my knight and everything is slightly loose so Prague needs to push the pawn but once he pushes the pawn there's a risk now Arjun cannot play his Knight back here or here that's just too passive he needs to think about some active move and there is a night sacrifice Knight takes G3 F takes G3 and your first intention is Queen G5 but if you play Queen G5 that is Queen E1 defending the rook and the pawn so you need to think something else instead of Queen G5 what do you do Arjun sacrifices the Knight what a move here three minutes for Arjun 50 seconds in fact now one minute 23 seconds for pragnananda and the move that Arjun is found is D3 what to move this is fantastic now only defense for Prague against Queen B6 check and queen coming in is to move his King to H1 this is very important because once you move it there Arjuna had actually seen the next move which is Rook F2 very important because if you go Queen G5 after Rook C8 game over because there's no check for black it's a mate so Rook F2 needs to be played and then Queen D6 only move Queen G5 Rook C8 takes King here check and it ends in a draw with a Perpetual so this is what Prague needs to do he needs to find King H1 move here he has 14 13 12 he's still going low on time he goes Bishop G2 this is a blunder a big mistake by Prague and can Arjun capitalize on it because firstly he needs to find this check which he most likely will and Prague cannot block it with his Queen because the pawn goes down to D2 and Arjun finds it with 34 seconds left on the clock so this is the line Queen C5 D2 black wins so that's the reason why you have to move your king now King H1 or King H2 if you go King H1 there's an additional option of hitting the rook and the pawn so that's the reason why King H2 seems more logical here but that's also losing King H2 and now Arjun can move in with his Queen to attack the G2 Pawn yes he finds Queen F2 now the G2 Bishop is falling he goes Rook G1 defends it now if you play D2 the queen and the Rook are cut off and Rook D1 and white is still in the game so Arjun needs to find this very pretty move rookie too and then push the pawn but with just one minute left on the clock will he be able to find this move he's bringing his hand closer what is he going to do whoa he finds it Rook E2 what a move by Arjun because now he goes D2 D1 deflecting the rook and it's Checkmate here there's no way for Prague to do anything he's this is the 40th move he has 10 seconds left he needs to find a move he goes Queen E7 and this is a smart move by Prague he says that I want to go Queen F6 check and trade the Queens when I will be upon a piece up but Arjun does not care he now pushes his Pawn to D2 and he tells Prague that my threat is D1 Queen you take and I'm going to Checkmate you or rookie one also very powerful threat So Pregnant getting 30 minutes extra on the clock thinking for five minutes plays Queen F6 and he's trading the Queens because he's a piece up so Arjun needs to take the queen so he takes Queen takes on F6 he takes F6 and now you take with the King yes okay very important moment now if you play the move Rook D1 trying to stop not rookie one you lose the pawn but King comes up now the problem is the bishop can't do here and you can see pragnananda burning up all his time he can cook in G1 but then rookie one comes so you can't play that you can't bring your Rook there okay maybe you want to bring your king out so you go G4 but I go King E5 you go King G3 up and now I go to q1 again d one is coming The Rook is undefended all these problems and pragnananda down to five minutes on the clock needs to find a move clearly he hasn't found one Rook f one check okay so now the king is attacked Arjun simply brings his King in King E5 strong move here and can you believe it this Pawn on D2 is stronger than the bishop on G2 King G1 played the point is if you go rookie one he wants to play let's say rookie one there is Bishop F3 stopping this and it's completely fine so he goes King D4 he brings his King into the position and he's planning to come to E3 Bishop F3 played hitting the rook and now if you go to here again King F2 and it's a draw so what does Arjun have on his mind here after Bishop F3 King E3 is his move whoa he's going to sacrifice The Rook now he's an entire Rook down but now this Pawn is as strong as a rook or even greater because it's going to become a queen goes Bishop G4 and he's hoping that Arjun plays rookie 1 here maybe he can go Bishop D1 but even that position is not not salvageable that is also lost but I think Arjun simply pushes his Pawn to H5 and forces prank to take this because even if you give a check I simply go back and there's no way to stop this so H5 played and Prague now finally takes the Rook Bishop takes E2 King takes on E2 with D1 Queens happens then it is totally winning for black so Rook F2 check arjun's King comes back once again threatening to Queen here The Rook F1 King comes to C2 and I want to make a queen again so pragnananda has very little options left he goes Rook F2 and he pins the pawn again he's his Rook is trying to somehow stop the pawn but now the king comes up and the threat is the one Queen so at this point Prague takes the pawn at least equalizes the pawn in the end game Arjun makes a queen he's already seen it that this King and pawn end game is winning Prague comes back and pins the queen so you're going to lose the queen but now after uh a good thing by Arjun he plays E5 fantastic move because now Prague does not have a move let's say for example he pushes his Pawn to B6 Arjun can take take and play King D2 you go King F2 I can go King D3 King F3 and now you can even make a waiting move or you can go with your king and take this Pawn let's say G5 if G4 I play H4 and then you have to give up your Pawn here and that is lost so in this position after B6 Arjun is thinking about his move you can see he's hardly looking at the board but he's seeing through to the end that does Prague have any defense he takes Queen takes F1 and it's all over the pawn end game is completely winning Arjun has won Prague resigns Arjun has managed to play an absolutely brilliant game with that moves D4 Knight G3 a D3 Queen B6 brilliant chest by him he has managed to win his first game with the black pieces in the quarterfinals against pragnananda and if he wins or draws the second one he will be through to the semi-finals and most likely will book his spot in the candidates Prague needs to win with the black pieces it's not going to be easy in the second game but for now Arjun can be proud of himself for playing a brilliant game of chess thank you foreign"},

game which means that if he wins this one or draws he is true to the semi-finals and also a spot in the candidates Arjun needs to win on demand and that too with the black pieces this is not at all going to be easy both players are just their pieces and it's time to go with the white pieces opens with D4 Knight F6 Knight comes out to F3 and now Arjun places Paul in the center to D5 what is Prague going to choose here is he going for the London system but maybe it's wiser to go for something more solid so he goes for the Queen's Gambit Knight to C3 and now Knight D7 this has been arjun's weapon in this must win situation even two rounds ago he did the same thing two games ago now Prague in that game had gone Bishop F4 and Arjun had responded with Bishop B4 and the position became tremendously complex so Prague is taking his time here and this time exchange is in the center c d e d and now places his Bishop on F4 the other Bishop goes to B4 pins the Knight somehow Arjun has to create play if he plays it very normally then Prague will easily get a position he can handle prague's idea is E3 Bishop D3 and so on A3 played by Prague he wants to get the bishop pair takes takes now he has the bishop pair and a pretty good position here that is castles and hit the center with C5 but that would lead to somehow equality so Arjun plays a risky chess he goes Knight C3 a good move here is Knight D2 giving up the spawn and queen C2 but Prague goes Queen C2 first and not the most accurate move because now Arjun can start to roll his King side pawns this is exactly why he put his Knight on e4 so that he can push these pawns and he does it he plays his Pawn to G5 his point is that if Prague goes Bishop G3 he goes H5 and this starts to get very risky which if you play your Pawn to H3 then this spoils your structure so what does Prague do here how does he respond to arjun's Arjun lashing out here one way is to go back to E3 but he actually goes to E5 and now this is his idea if you go F6 Bishop G3 later when you play H5 and the Knight takes here there is a check on G6 which is the reason why let's say this take check and then take here that's the reason why Prague has come to E5 and to provoke F6 the best move here is short Castle but it's very tough to play it's almost impossible when you have pushed the spawn to G5 why would you shot cast oh Arjun plays it wow what a guy Arjun he finds a great move he castles your and now the idea is to push this Knight away and then chop off this bishop in fact instead of castling Knight E5 was also possible but white would have taken with the Knight so that's the reason why Arjun has castled here now how does Prague play further he needs to start developing his pieces because black has some plans in mind G4 Knight takes Bishop Queen comes out and so on time-wise Arjuna is 4 minutes 22 seconds prank has 3 minutes 33 seconds sometimes when you are in the lead it can also get a bit stressful because you are seeing the victory line closer than before Pawn pushes forward 92 and now Arjun can take on D2 and then on E5 he can also take on E5 first he takes on E5 and now Prague takes back one plan is to take the Knight on D2 but this move is very classy to bring the Knight to C5 because the Knight is so well placed here no one can kick it away it looks at the bishop which will eventually come to D3 it is also looking at the B3 Square so will Arjun be able to find this move it's not so simple because there are other Alternatives as well but if you are playing this in a must win scenario you want to maintain more pieces on the board you don't want to exchange pieces with Knight takes D2 3 minutes 28 seconds for Prague three minutes 35 seconds for Arjun he plays it wow Arjun has found some great moves until now with short Castle Knight C5 and he's putting a lot of pressure on Prague who needs to hear draw or win in order to progress although the pawn on G4 has a lot of mood away from its Camp it's not so simple to take advantage of it one idea can be H3 because when you take I go G3 and then I pick it up with my bishop and my Rook gets activated along with the queen so that's one idea to play H3 the other idea is to maybe trade the knights with Knight B3 that could also be playable Prague decides to place Bishop to D3 and he's saying to Arjun if you take here I'm very happy with my position here but Arjun has a very powerful move in this position and that one requires great great understanding it is to play Queen to G5 and attack this Pawn now why is this more difficult because you're giving up a pawn with a check you have to understand that after King G7 the king is absolutely safe here and The Rook could move to h8 the pawn on E5 is hanging and Arjun finds it he plays Queen G5 another brilliant move with a series of moves Arjun has rested over the initiative now of course he understands that taking this Pawn is not helping his cause so much but then what to play is also a very big question do you want to play H3 to open things up not so sure not so sure here and Prague is also running lower on time he's down to two minutes 14 seconds after Queen G5 where does he play his pieces what are the possible moves that he has well you you don't want to Castle because once you Castle I can take on D3 Queen D3 and queen takes E5 black is a healthy Pawn up there and you can see that Prague is unable to find the best solution there he is getting a bit tired about what to do here Arjun has played this so well one minute 36 seconds he goes H3 now a good idea here is to take take and play gx3 because the bishop controls here and once you take here to take the E5 Pawn you are Pawn up Tuck the king away but instead Arjun takes straight away on E5 maybe not the best because after H takes G4 Now The Rook opens up which is very risky Bishop takes G4 but Arjun has kind of figured it out that if you take here then it's not so risky The Rook is doing not much and if you take with the bishop then my king comes forward and somehow you can't coordinate your queen and Rook to reach at seven wow this is bold Brave play by Arjun Prague has one minute 13 seconds arjuna's two minutes 58 seconds look at arjun's cool and calmness Bishop takes at seven played Arjun moves forward and now Knight comes out to F3 attacking the queen well it definitely would make sense to take this guy now because the Knight is well placed you can also move your queen away but taking feels like the right decision 2 minutes 44 seconds for arjunar you guys see one minute 12 seconds for truck Arjun is actually considering whether he wants to take here or not because once he takes Pawn takes it opens up another file to the king and if white just moves his King up the other Rook is ready to join in so it's not an easy decision whether to take that night or not but at the same time if you do not take then white is coordinating himself pretty quickly with Rook coming in and also the Rook moving up the board and he takes it Bishop takes F3 G takes F3 now Arjun needs to bring his Rook to h8 he brings it he brings and puts pressure on the bishop so for the time being everything looks fine for black maybe he'll just maneuver his King towards the center and not keep it here the pawns are right now equal Five Pawns each the Knight for black the bishop for white who is better whose King is weaker is the King on E1 weaker or the King on G7 one thing is for sure the extra minute that Arjun has is a big asset for him King moves to E2 and it's not easy to find a good move here what is to be played because Arjun has one minute 41 seconds few options that he has is one king f8 to put the king away from the G5 the other one is to bring his Rook to the center Rook ae8 but he goes A5 what a creative idea not the best but his point could be to clamp this position or maybe get his Rook into here somehow he wants to get this Rook gives a check King has to move to f8 and now F4 it's time to push the queen away yes with F4 you do lose control on the E4 square but the queen is so well placed right now in the center you need to push it away F4 plane now where does black queen go the only logical and good Square seems Queen F6 keeping an eye on the C3 Pawn will Arjun find Queen F6 yes he finds it Queen to F6 with one minute 20 seconds on the clock Brock has 27 his best move now is Rook H5 looking at D5 and also doubling down the H5 finds it beautiful chest by both these players and now if you waste time with C6 then already Rook comes to F5 it's a very very powerful position or you can even double down the H5 so not so easy to play this but there's a cool move here Knight E4 you can't take this because the Rook is hanging and otherwise if you take the Central Pawn I have Knight C3 check and you lose the Rook so he plays Knight E4 fantastic oppon comes to C4 but now there is a move Queen C3 very tough to find take take and it's okay here for black this position is good Queen C3 is the best move there's also Knight C3 check followed by D4 which is playable but what is Arjun going to play he's also down to 40 seconds 22 seconds for Prague when it comes to Blitz chess there is no one who has better nerves than our generic icy buddy blunders here he plays his Queen the best move now is to bring your roof back so that you can threaten to take here it's not a tall and easy move to find the most natural is Rook gh1 but then the Knight drops back here to F6 and attacks The Rook with Rook H1 you take out that Knight F6 thread but Queen B2 that's not a good move now Arjun can actually take Queen takes C4 and plays Queen to C3 that would mean that he has a fine position here but Arjun with 25 seconds on the clock needs to figure out what to do the other logical move and the only move is to bring the Knight back so that his Rook is safe on h8 is he going to do that yes he plays with 15 seconds Prague is down to seven seconds he needs to respond he goes Rook at six that's fine next move he can chop off the Knight with F6 or he can Arjun takes look at seven now take on at seven Knight at seven give a check and then take this black is still oh he plunders he plunders your queen takes F6 because rookette six with the X-ray of the queen it's just complete Rook up and there you can see Prague just sort of mildly banging the table and saying that oh no I have just plundered a complete Rook Queen F6 you never see Prague emoting this much as well but here now Arjun rook d8 and you can literally sense that Prague is lost now and that means that the match is equalized once again Queen goes to C6 Queen B3 and Arjun now brings his rook and there you have it pragnananda knows he's botched this up Arjun is back and the match continues what a marathon encounter between these two Gladiators takes takes Queen A2 Prague resigns Arjun has dodged the bullet here he has managed to survive in the five plus three second as well the match is tied at 4-4 and we go into a sudden death of three plus two what unbelievable players the toss is done Arjun gets the black pieces whoever wins the three plus two game goes through what a match between these two youngsters the ultimate gems of Indian chess foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music]"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

pressure on pragnananda here to stay in the tournament and Arjun opens with one E4 what is pragnananda's weapon going to be in this must win encounter well Sicilian it is that is quite expected he goes for C5 and Arjun plays the alapin with C3 Prague brings his Knight out attacks the pawn and tells Arjun hey now your knight can no longer come to C3 so you have to push the pawn and trucks Knight jumps to D5 this Knight F6 variation against the elephant is a good way to try and play for a win Knight comes out to F3 and now Prague brings his Knight to C6 white does have space because of the E5 pawn and now he gains even more space with D4 Prague has to decide which line to go for because he cannot afford the position becoming too dry she takes on D4 C takes D4 and now he breaks in the center with D6 very nice move if you were to take he takes D6 then a good move is E6 and then chopping the pawn with the bishop so Arjun goes Bishop C4 hitting the Knight the Knight goes back hitting the bishop and now the bishop comes to B5 pinning here and Prague goes Bishop D7 breaking the PIN once again the point is if you take on D6 I'll go E6 and chop this Pawn with my Bishop so he goes Knight to C3 develops his Knight Pawn takes Pawn has happened and here D takes on E5 black plays his Pawn up to G6 and prague's hope is to get the bishop here and attack this Pawn on E5 Arjun quickly castles he has a very free-flowing position with lot of space but Prague also is quite happy because his pieces are now well developed he plays Bishop G7 and queen E2 defending the pawn on E5 how should truck continue here he castles it out he has one hour three minutes Arjun has one hour nine minutes and he thinks for 17 minutes here before going for the move H3 logical move stopping Bishop G4 so that the E5 Pawn is well protected and truck goes Bishop E6 and he tells Arjun that I am okay with you spoiling my structure because then I won't take back but rather I have an intermediate move skewering here so Arjun first goes Rook D1 hits the queen queen comes to C7 and now the bishop comes out to F4 defending the pawn on E5 Rook 88 The Rook moves to the Central Square it's very difficult to imagine Prague actually creating any real counter play in this position and in a must twin situation it is definitely not easy but you don't really think about winning here you just keep making moves Knight to D5 played and Arjun takes the Knight foreign move here is Knight to D4 pinning the Knight even further here and Arjun does play it Knight to D4 on the board Queen comes out to B6 now the queen is attacking the bishop as well as the Knight Bishop takes C6 followed by B3 would have been nice but instead he takes with the Knight now Prague takes back with the pawn and tells Arjun that if you go back to D3 I might chop your A2 Pawn so suddenly some play starting to flow prague's way Bishop C4 Arjun very very solid there but the point is yeah you take and now you take back with the queen and your B2 Pawn is hanging so you can either take it first or first truck takes on D1 Arjun takes it back and now you can take the pawn on B2 excellent move because now after Queen takes C6 you can either take on A2 or you can even take on E5 not so sure if this is winning as such but it is definitely upon a position but Arjun finds a great move he goes E6 and with Queen F6 truck goes back and Arjun brings his Bishop back and he says if you take this Pawn your pawns are going to be doubled F takes E6 would not be a good move because then Queen side is very weak so he takes with the queen Arjun captures the queen F takes E6 Prague is right now two pawns up but he's going to lose his first pawn bishop takes A7 and the remaining pawns are weak and double you can feel that Prague is not very thrilled with his position here uh it's not like a tall winning but there is at least something to play for so he goes through K8 and he tells Arjun that if you move your Bishop you lose your Pawn so clearly Arjun has to go in with his Rook defending the bishop and also attacking the E7 Pawn so you go King F7 now if you were to play a move like Bishop C5 hitting here then Bishop F6 is pretty fine so good move now is King F1 but Arjun blunders here well it's not really a blunder but it's a small mistake A4 because now Bishop comes to E5 and the key Point here is that after Bishop C5 Rook A4 there is a back crank issue here so even if you take here black is clearly better if Arjun had instead of A4 played King F1 it would have been way better now he plays King F1 but now after Bishop B6 Prague has kind of Trapped The Rook stop Bishop C5 and has serious initiative in the position Arjun brings his King up Pawn comes to E5 and now threatening King E6 this is getting slowly and steadily very tricky for Arjun how is he going to meet it he goes King to D3 and he sees that his Rook has the B7 Square so he plays Here and Now Rook to B7 The Rook moves to the side and the King comes up ahead in the center King D5 played and prague's idea is to play C5 and King C6 so F3 played and once C5 is played now Arjun has to be very alert King C6 would drop a piece here on A7 so the only move in this position is to play A5 so as to meet King C6 with A6 and everything is safe it's still not winning as such Rook f8 played by Prague and forcing Arjun to push the pawn and now he actually goes back and says sorry you can't move your Rook you can't move your Bishop because this is hanging and Arjun may want to play on the king side with his pawns maybe H4 is a good move but he goes King C3 and G5 by Prague fantastic chess he's now pushing his pawns on the king side with H5 and this is becoming really a difficult endgame for Arjun because Prague has now G4 break in hand maybe to create an e-passer but King C3 is a huge error because now with E4 coming in Prague dissolves his doubled pawns gets the E passer on the board and also his King is Super Active what a play by pragnananda from a completely equal game he has now magically created so many chances King F4 this is also cool because now after Bishop takes C5 Bishop takes C5 King takes C5 Rook takes Rook takes and Rook a two black is totally winning here so you can't do that he goes King to B5 and here pragos H4 fantastic move Rook D7 played Arjun wants his Rook here and maybe at some point take this Pawn but King goes to G3 Bishop B6 and the idea is A7 and Rook d8 and so Prague has to be careful he starts pushing his C Pawn of course you can't take here because you lose the pride of your position that is the Pawn on A6 so what do you do Bishop to C7 played of course pragnananda has seen this he takes here Rook takes C7 Bishop takes C7 Rook takes and now King takes G2 and when The Rook comes back to C5 Prague has a special move prepared Rook G8 defending the pawn placing a lot of trust on his G pawns and Edge Pawn A7 white Pawn is about to Queen but look at this Prague is now three pawns up and this these are very strong one and you can't take on G5 because Rook G5 is a check so he goes King A6 and now you can simply push your Jeep on G4 you have to be careful because Arjun is now going King D7 and Rook C8 which is what he does and uh black won't be able to stop the white Pawn from queening but he is planning to make his own Queen G3 and Arjun goes Rook C8 now has to decide what to do he takes Rook takes King takes on C8 and now the G Pawn advances further G2 so in the end when both sides Queen Arjun Queen's here and Prague also Queens here on G1 black is three points up however he has some checks now is this going to be a perpetual Queen G3 he puts the queen in and now if you play Queen F5 Queen G4 pins it here so you need to give another check he goes Queen H1 King G4 comes out and queen E4 check Queen goes back to F4 Queen E2 check King H3 slowly and steadily pragnananda making some progress here because you had no checks available so he takes here on E7 but now it's time to push your C Pawn he does it he plays C3 and again no checks from here and here because Queen interposes and it pins the queen so Arjun goes back and stops that pawn Prague now plays a very very nice move these are the moves which are tough in Queen end games where you don't give a check but you just hang in there somewhere King H2 and you control all the key squares so he goes Queen C2 check and now King G3 played again no Queen G6 check because of Queen G4 counter check so he goes Queen C1 and what is Prague planning to do with his Queen where to give a where to move it he goes Queen C6 check he has two minutes to work this out king B8 it's important not to keep your queen too far away because if the queen is somewhere here then white can continuously give checks to the black king but you need to keep your queen more Central and that is exactly what Prague is doing look at this queen C5 check King B7 and now you will see the queen has taken control of the G G1 square and so he pushes his Pawn fantastic end game technique shown here by pragnananda a lot to learn from him as he plays these Queen and games Queen F2 the queen comes back again to the aid of the king queen E5 check and now the king is going further ahead or where do you play it he plays his King to H3 now Queen E6 check King H2 check Queen G3 and somehow there is no check on the second rank because I block and give you a counter check so Queen C5 and now H3 played the king moves to A6 Arjun trying to keep the king away from any counter checks that can happen one of the most important traits you need to develop when playing Queen and games is patience as The Winning Side you should not hurry too much and here look at that drug again Queen D2 a calm little move and threatening to play C1 Queen so Arjun gives a check and the King goes to H1 between four check and the queen goes to G2 with this no checks are possible because if Queen E1 there is Queen G1 check and this is a key element in Queen end games that to a check there often comes a counter check Arjun Place Queen s King A6 frog is being very careful there he sees why is Arjun still playing on he can make a queen here now right so and Arjun is very tricky so Prague is just being very sure whether he should make the queen or not he makes it another queen on the board and I think it's time for Arjun to resign he resigns the game the score is 1-1 they move into the tie breaks what a tense encounter this was for pragnananda because and the Arbiter comes there for a toss already for the tie break games uh she puts the pieces behind her and asks Arjun to choose Arjun gets white in their first 25 plus 10 minute 25 plus 10 rapid and a great great game by Prague because he was almost on the brink of elimination and somehow managed to create his chances while Arjun did Buckle Under Pressure he had a great position but he couldn't manage to keep control the match now goes into tie breaks and we'll see what happens between these two young amazing stars of Indian chess [Music] [Applause] thank you"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

have anyone thought that the 69th seed of the tournament would actually be there right until the last four but there he is nijat and he faces his biggest challenge Magnus opens the game with one E4 plays his Pawn up to C5 we have the Sicilian it means it's going to be a big fight here Knight F3 Magnus brings his Knight out and abbasov has to decide between the various options that Sicilian offers night C6 played Will Magnus go for the open Sicilian or will he play the roseolimo well he goes for the rozolimo bishop to B5 black has many ways to play this G6 E6 but E6 has been nijat's choice in this tournament he also played it against with it and landed in not so great position so Magnus wants to test it once again he takes on C6 B Tech C6 and because nijat plays this quite often many have thought that he is currently working with rajabo because this is rajabo's one of the main openings B6 played black has this beautiful Center also the bishop pair but white has lead in development and this move E5 now generally you want to push your Pawn forward but then the C5 Pawn becomes weak you know you can attack it and that's why Nija takes the pawn and the game between with it continued with 95 Queen ng4 and in this way the game had gone with white having a small Edge but Magnus does not even take the pawn he plays D3 and Nija still in his prep goes F6 and Magnus brings the other Knight to D2 so this is some high level prep here you can see nijat now trying to think over the board but he plays his moves so quickly Knight at six white is a pawn down but at the same time Black's Queen side pawns are isolated and doubled Rook G1 what an idea you want to go G4 G5 now the best move here is Queen A5 so that if you go G4 there is the C4 takes an E4 somehow you have to play very actively but ninja smooth Bishop A6 is just not at all good because you're putting a bishop on the Square where there is no real counter play maybe he's misasses something because now Magnus goes G4 and his threat is G5 and if he gets that successfully The Rook would be really active on G1 Knight goes back to F7 trying to stop G5 at least if G5 you can play F5 so Magnus goes Queen E2 and he's putting more pressure on the E5 point so that when G5 is played Black cannot go F5 and abuso just develops his Bishop to E7 well magnus's opening play has been highly successful especially because black hasn't got that quick counter play which is needed with the C4 break and you know you just sacrifice that pawn try to activate your position that hasn't happened Bishop B2 and now places Queen to A5 pinning the Knight here but this time maybe it's a bit too late Magnus can just push his Pawn to G5 now but instead he likes the smooth C4 firstly he sort of fixes these pawns and secondly he's preparing long castling because once you long Castle here black cannot take on A2 because the king comes up and The Rook moves to A1 G5 played by Nija so he stopped magnus's G5 he nips it in the bud and now Magnus what does he do he goes H4 he's trying to create play on the king side keeping it open and maybe at the right time he might get in the G5 move a bus of places spawned to H6 is trying to hold on to things together and now Magnus plays his Rook to H1 interesting because when he takes here he wants to look at the black Rook oh black long castles wow Black's position is pretty okay from the sense that he is a pawn up and has a nice structure but his main problem is this bishop on C8 if you look at it it has absolutely no scope Magnus also long castles if you take the pawn now King C2 is just completely winning for white so abaso cannot take it he goes back Queen to C7 here how should Magnus go about trying to break this structure is a is a good question he goes Knight to E4 and his idea is to keep pressurizing these points these important points in the opponent's Camp a bus off can maintain the tension here but instead he takes and he feels that it's now time for him to create his own play which could revolve around Rook G8 to put pressure on G4 or maybe an eventual F5 if he gets it Knight takes H4 has been played the Knight is looking to come to G6 Rook G8 played stopping it and now G4 is under pressure Magnus plays F4 wow he's trying to open up the position because after takes he has Knight takes F6 along with the bishop looking in here but you know amongst all of this what is happening is with the position opening up the bishop pair starts to get more and more risky so is the world's number one player losing control here Knight takes F6 played he's attacked The Rook he's also attacked the E6 Pawn here to give a check Bishop took the Knight and now intermediate check could be nice because he can also take take the bishop with Bishop takes F6 Magnus takes it one thing which you have to appreciate nijat is his time management even though he's put under so much pressure he's maintained quite a decent time on the clock 33 minutes and they still have to make 18 moves before they reach 40 move 40 King B8 played King is stuck to the side and very important to take the bishop with the queen if you had taken this with the bishop then Rook D E8 would have hit the queen so Queen takes F6 and now Nija adds through Bishop finally breathes it wants to take here and it's good news Magnus takes his time and finds the best move in the position Rook D E1 his idea is to come in here so for example if you were to take this then rookie 7 Rook D7 Queen F7 and you lose material so nijat first places Rook to D6 attacks the queen and asks it to leave white takes the pawn queen takes on F4 and now Rook to G4 played wow this is getting so exciting both sides have only four pawns now left but look at the black pieces the activity which they have Queen E3 played by Magnus and what does Nija do now he has an active move at his disposal which is Rook to E6 fantastic move the Rook attacks the queen and it has to move away Queen D2 played okay structurally still white is better but Black's Beast activity is just something very very special and now Nija brings his Knight into the game his threats could involve Rook takes H4 Rook takes H4 Knight takes D3 check and then picking up this Rook on E1 so Magnus quickly brings his King up to C2 and nijat also brings his King away from this perhaps a diagonal which he does not like King on B7 feels safe for him and Magnus now finds a good move he plays rookie 3 stopping Rook G3 business and maybe at some point he wants to move his Knight here maybe he wants to double Queen E7 player very interesting choice by nijat because he's attacking the Knight however he's allowing the Knight to come to F5 with the tempo and he plays Knight F5 so what is his idea because if he is not careful this can become a dangerous threat here also The Rook can come in the night is well placed Queen G5 played very interesting and if Magnus were to take here on E5 you can't take on F5 because Rook H E1 and white is doing really well you can try it but this is better Bishop E5 played the best move now is Rook 2 G2 and in fact nijat finds it Rook G2 and you can see there Magnus is under tremendous pressure because his opponent is finding some great moves here Rook has to come back otherwise you will be in trouble and now not to take here that would be a positional mistake but rookie too good move and after Queen takes now you can pick up the Knight and the position has simplified a lot it has simplified to the extent that now it's opposite colored Bishops and the position is around equal so fantastic play by nijat matching Magnus Carlsen move by move Rook H5 attacking the queen now the queen has to move but where exactly should It Go Queen F7 is played to keep an eye on The Rook and here perhaps King B2 may be tucking the king at A3 would be an idea but he goes Queen H2 and this is a massive blunder because nijat has a winning move Queen F1 and the point is wherever you go with your Rook I just take and then there are these threads Queen F2 and The Rook is hanging in many of the lines so Queen F1 is an amazing mode so the threat is Rook G6 and Rook G2 however nijat misses it he goes Rook G6 that was a very very tough opportunity that he had received to win the game but he couldn't find it and now Magnus is back in the game but he's living dangerously here Bishop F4 I like this move a lot the main point of this move is that you want to reroute the bishop to E3 and attack the pawn on C5 and so Nija plays Rook F6 but I think he's missed magnus's next move and this is what Magnus does brilliantly his Bishop was not bad on E5 but he understood that it needs to be regrouped and now F2 square is controlled by the bishop and the bishop is attacking the pawn on C5 along with the Rook Bishop F5 played and now well nijat also understands that in opposite colored Bishops material is not the most important so he gives up a pawn in order to put pressure on the D3 Pawn here Queen G6 played putting pressure on D3 with a check and Magnus plays his King to C3 so that if you were to take on D3 there is this sacrifice Bishop A7 now he blunders with through k6 Rook E6 Bishop A7 is a classy move because if King A7 Queen C7 King 8 there is Queen F5 and if you play take check King A6 there's C5 threatening a mate but Magnus does not spot it he plays Rook H4 which is not a good move Ninja at back in the game Bishop G4 we are on move number 39 now Magnus has to make his final move Before Time control and he takes the pawn and at the right time he's done it but here black has a defense check Bishop back and queen G5 and it's an equal position Queen G7 check is important here will nijat find it with 27 seconds left left no he goes Queen F6 that is a big mistake because now he does not have control of the C7 square if he had given this check and if Magnus would have gone up then King A7 is possible because there's no more check here available with with this check he can now play his King to B4 Magnus thinks for a bit he got 30 minutes on the clock and now it's all over King B4 and nijat has now 30 minutes to figure out if there's any good option but there is none he he made a mistake on the 40th move and that will cost him in a big way Rook has come to E5 his point is if you play Bishop D4 there is Queen E7 check so he goes D4 attacking the rook and also this bishop is hanging if you try to save it this way Queen B8 check his game over so that's the reason why he goes Queen E7 but now Magnus can just push his spawn or even get his Bishop here but I think pushing the pawn makes a lot of sense because the Rook cannot move anymore there is a mate here nijat resigns Magnus wins it what a game that was in the end there was so much pressure on both the players making errors let's listen to their post game analysis and try to see what they have to say foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music]"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis

amazing player brilliant at calculations absolutely strong in his opening prep and today he takes on the 18 year old Prodigy our pragnananda the Phenom from India who's played brilliantly at this tournament eliminating Hikaru Nakamura and is now through to the semi-finals and also the candidates tournament Prague has shown great resilience especially in his quarter finals encounter against Arjun erikaisi and this is the first game of the classical match karwana opens with one E4 and while Fabi has taken off his jacket Prague keeps it on as always Prague likes to take his time in the opening he has developed this new ritual where he doesn't really close his eyes he's observing the board maybe then tries to focus himself calms himself down and tries to get in the right right mindset before making his move and he has a few options of his sleeve Sicilian is something that Prague has played before also he has played E4 E5 let's see what he's going to do today karwana extremely calm there he plays E5 and now this might be either rui Lopez or Italian let's see Knight comes out to F3 develops his Knight to C6 important moment is it Bishop C4 or Bishop B5 it's actually Bishop C4 we have the Italian and Prague is one big expert in this but Fabi is an even bigger expert in the Italian C3 played and Prague brings his night out to F6 there's a direct line with D4 but the more positional lines go D3 and they lead to much more complex games much more fighting chess with more opportunities for both sides to go wrong Prague now takes a bit of time and places Pawn up to A6 it's a useful move and generally Prague we have seen likes to keep his Pawn on A6 and not on A5 that's how he's played Bishop goes to G5 the trend of developing your Bishop early to G5 continues in top level modern chess and that took before why black has castled so Prague asks a question to the bishop do you want to take on F6 of course not says Fabi and now G5 is a very viable play way to play you can never sacrifice your knight in that position but first Prague goes D6 and karwana develops his Knight to D2 so all pretty normal until now in fact there have been many top level games that have gone through this variation Bishop A7 played by Prague just removing the Bishop from a D4 uh Tempo that could hit it it goes to A7 and now white simply castles and would Prague also Castle here is the question because once you Castle this pin becomes a little more threatening so Queen E7 played by Prague and one of the ideas is to put your Bishop on E6 and if he takes to take with the queen breaking the PIN B4 played by Fabi gaining space on the queen side and now Prague places Bishop to E6 offering a trade what is karwana going to do here is he going to take on E6 or is he going to gain even more space with A4 that's one of the main moves in the position and he does it he plays his Pawn to A4 he has one hour 31 minutes on the clock Prague now has to decide what to do here he goes shortcastles yes he plays it his King is safe now he's not too worried about this pin because he knows he can at any point take on C4 and break the pin with Queen E6 here Rook E1 is played and generally this move is very useful defending the pawn on e4 and preparing Pawn to D4 that's why the Rook often is very well placed there Bishop takes Bishop has happened and now you want to take with the Knight yes that's how you take it now this Knight on C4 is very interestingly placed at some moments it can go to A5 and attack B7 and at some moments it can go to E3 and look at these two squares Prague goes Queen E6 and he tells uh Fabi that look I'm going to get my knight off the board very soon so you need to think about your Bishop then it would do nothing here so might as well you want to exchange it well B5 is played by Fabi he tries to create his play and taking here might not be the best idea because it opens up the Rook so first Prague goes Knight to E7 and he's okay if karwana takes here to take back that is fine for him now Rook to B1 is a small Innovation by Fabi earlier some games have gone Bishop F6 Queen F6 and Rook B1 because then the bishop is no longer uh sort of misplaced slightly on H4 so for Prague after Rook B1 a clear idea and you can see he's taking his time is to go G5 kick this bishop away and then continue the game that could be one way to play because his opponent hasn't taken the other way is to remove the knight from F6 and maybe put it on D7 so that it can look at the C5 and B6 squares Prague is taking his time at this moment and rightly so because karwana's move hasn't been played very often this has been however played in the game by uh one of the games of Amin tabatabai against you young he goes Knight to D7 and interesting move by Prague as we noted that he wanted his Knight to be taken off from the F6 Square now karwana sits down and realizes that if he is not careful then this Knight could move away and so he takes on E7 and then the Bishop has done its job it's taken Here and Now Queen takes E7 so we have an imbalance here black has a beautiful Bishop on this diagonal uh White has very nice Knight placed on C4 and also space on the queen side and karwana now next makes a fantastic move d4 the point of this is that pragnananda now has to deal with these pawns if he takes ever then after Pawn takes white has a brilliant Center but on the other hand white can never really take on E5 because then the bishop opens up and you can never push forward with D5 because then the C5 square is weak so Prague comes up with the queen and he kind of tempts Fabi please push the pawn so that I can go back now and then I can come here to the C5 square with my knight of course karuana being the player that he is is never going to get tempted by the move D5 so what does he do a good way is to maintain all the tension in the position and defend this Knight on C4 by Queen to D3 and maybe that is the best way to continue here karwana is thinking other options do include Queen to B3 you you don't want to go to A5 and attack this because Bishop B6 and the Knight is not doing much there it could get trapped so Queen D3 fantastic move played by Fabi and karwana is just very slightly putting pressure on Prague Prague has to now decide what to do one of White's plan is Knight E3 and going to F5 or D5 so rookie 8 makes a lot of sense keeping pressure on D4 but truck goes Rook B8 and in fact now karwana can actually play for this plan 93 it's not at all a bad idea the Knight could jump here or to the F5 Square but there's also there are other ways to play this position and one of them is to take here on on A6 take here and then use your knight to attack these weak squares on C6 B7 also when the Knight jumps here okay he's taken first of all this is getting very exciting now because Prague has to respond by Taking Back for now Prague is not at the board he is yeah there he is back and he takes back B takes A6 and here's the move that we are thinking about Knight A5 attacking the C6 square and also attacking the A6 Pawn very important they spawn on A6 is a weakness meanwhile white has a very strong Center so Black's position does look pretty bad karwana takes on B8 here now for Prague it's a question should you take with the Knight but if you take with the Knight then after d e d e 95 you lose a pawn so you don't want to take with the Knight if you don't take with the Knight you can take with the bishop but the bishop is kind of misplaced here it was on a good diagonal and I can just rotate my knight to this good Square so the other option comes Rook takes B8 but if you notice this is the most natural move right wise product thinking so much well the reason is he is unhappy with the move Knight A5 here because now the threat is to come here to C6 and the most important point to note here is that if you try to stop the knight from coming here the Knight anyway jumps in and attacks the bishop if you take there is D5 and Drug you can see there is a time lapse that we've put which shows Prague thinking about this position for nearly 20 minutes to this position there is a very nice resource with Knight C5 because if you take now I can take and there is no D5 so Prague is calculating all these deep lines when actually The Rook is taken and finally he takes back Rook takes B8 clearly he's found something in the line which has made him go for this but you know for many out there this was just a simple recapture but actually Prague has thought for more than 25 minutes there Knight comes to A5 just as we imagine now the Knight is coming to C6 how is Prague going to respond to this Rook B6 is playable it's in fact the best move but then this Knight C6 you have to see the all the complicated lines here Rook B6 Knight C6 Knight C5 and then if the queen moves away then you take D5 you are ready to sacrifice an exchange and so on these are the complex lines that you have to calculate after Rook B6 but Prague decides to take on D4 and prague's point is that if you take here I'm pretty happy because now I got D5 my queen defends this so karwana makes the intermed so he puts his Knight on C6 and attacks the rook and the bishop now Prague must find the next move which he actually must have seen when he was thinking for 20 minutes and the next move is to play Knight to C5 fantastic move played by Prague two options one is to take the pawn the other one is to Simply move the queen behind why would you play this the reason is I'm attacking the rook and the bishop and let's say The Rook saves the bishop then now I get two connected pawns that is the main reason however here you can take dtec C3 and if he plays Knight A7 then Rook B2 and black is winning this position and if you play Knight takes B8 then Bishop B8 and black has excellent compensation so karwana may not want to move his Queen back to D1 he may want to take on D4 with the queen but once he does that the issue is that his structure becomes slightly broken up but that's the thing about these top level players they are more about concrete calculations and less about just feel now Rook is attacked Bishop is attacked Rook B7 would be a huge blunder there is a four coming in here so that's the reason why Prague plays Rook 8 the best move in the position now karwana has a great move here which is to play Pawn to A5 now why is this such a special move the reason is that once you push your Pawn to A5 which he does the bishop cannot move out one once the bishop cannot move out the Rook cannot move because then the bishop would fall so all in all this is a very very dangerous position for Prague he goes Queen E8 asks the Knight if you want to dislodge yourself because now Rook text would be completely fine for black but but karwana has an excellent movie or which is Queen to D5 defending the Knight will he find it and if he plays it then Prague is yes he finds it he plays it Prague actually here has an only move to be fine in the game otherwise he's much worse here and that move is Knight D3 just look at this move it unleashes the bishop on F2 square and you might ask can the queen simply not take the Knight well the point is I'll take back your knight and that's the reason why Knight D3 works and Prague finds it of course he is so sharp positionally he managed to find oh but Fabi has an intermed so he gives a check he's like Prague if you take my knight I'll take your with the check and Prague is ready with that move as well he's seen it maybe you go yeah King h8 makes a lot of sense you don't want to go to H7 because after Queen takes D3 E5 would lead to a discovered check so King goes to h8 and now the problem is this is hanging and this is hanging and if you go to F1 there's Knight F4 which is very powerful so he takes Prague now takes on E7 so the position has simplified a bit but the position Still Remains very dangerous and karwana's next move shows such deep understanding here he's taken off back rank threats he's bringing the king to G2 clearly he cannot take the pawn right now because of Bishop F2 check and he loses the queen Prague goes Bishop C5 he just improves the position of his Bishop white holds all the trumps there's a weakness on A6 there's an ability to break E5 and he goes Knight D4 but not the best move because now Prague can actually take Pawn takes and create counter play with C5 and in such a position black should be completely fine but instead he goes Queen D7 he plays his Queen here an inaccurate move he wants to come to A4 if Fabi is not very careful the queen can go here attack this put pressure here but Queen C4 is such a classy move by karwana he's stopping the queen from coming to A4 and now with 10 more moves to make and Prague going low on time it's actually big trouble here truck has less than 10 minutes on the clock he goes King G8 now karuana again a quiet nice little move King G2 improving the position of his King Prague has to decide what is the way in which he creates counter play because now Bishop D4 is also met with C takes D4 so he goes Rook A7 kind of unusual move not really sure what his aim is because if karwana improves his position yes he does Rook B1 threatening maybe a check infiltrating with this Rook what is Prague actually doing it's very difficult to say maybe his last move was aimed against defending the B7 square and A6 pawn and now with Queen E8 which he plays he's now stopped The Rook from entering into B8 so in this way he's assumed a very strong defensive position he's also attacking the E4 pawn and now Knight goes going back seems logical but karwana goes Queen D5 another powerful move perhaps the Knight can again sit down on C6 that would be too too dangerous well maybe I can just take on D4 yes he takes it Bishop takes D4 has happened and now Pawn takes on D4 is played uh if we play C6 now that's decent because if you take there is Queen takes E4 but maybe C6 Queen F5 can come so Prague first goes G6 but that is not a good idea now one of the best moves in the position very tough to play is King F3 defending E4 but he goes E5 and now we are on to move number 35 Prague has to decide what to do here maybe he can take the pawn and he takes it pontex pawn and he has an idea now after karwana most likely will also recapture back with his Pawn black will have an additional weakness on C7 yes he does but truck can now move into a rook end game by putting his Queen on A8 and that's an important move to play yes he plays it Queen eight we are going into a rook end game but still the problems have not been solved now you can one take your Rook takes but that improves the position of the black Rook so why don't we go Queen F3 this is a very subtle move and Fabi finds it what a move because now if black takes I'll take with my king and activate my king this way with white and on the other hand black does not have too many moves the queen can't move the Rook cannot move anywhere and so Prague now kind of lashes out with C5 which is logical because you're pushing your past Pawn but you have weakened the B6 Square and this B6 square is so important if the Rook sits there it's going to be a monster and Fabi instantly takes that square he's taken the Rook there and he wants to place his Rook on C6 and then capture the pawn on C5 so Prague first takes the queen King takes on F3 has happened we are on move number 39 so this is critical movement in the game now karwana here uh definitely feels he's better prank pushes his Pawn to C4 it's very important now to not get tempted with Rook C6 instantly and to actually improve your king here King E3 this is still may be holdable after a move like Rook D7 but he goes Rook C6 and this is Moon number 40 and Trump finds the best defensive move what a move by Prague and the point that Prague says is that if you take Rook C4 I have Rook D5 hitting E5 and A5 and there you can see Prague getting up from the board now 30 minutes added on the clock karuana's last move actually drops his Advantage quite seriously he should have brought his King in to stop the pawn but instead he went with his rook and now with Rook D7 coming to D5 attacking here one idea is King E4 this could be played but then Rook D2 attacking here and let's say I play F4 then you lose the pawn Rook takes A6 again very difficult to calculate but after Rook G2 maybe this Pawn is hanging the edge Pawn is coming down the board it can become a very very sharp end game the other option for karwana is to take the pawn on A6 but even there it's not so simple because Rook takes A6 I would push the pawn down the board C3 he takes it he takes on A6 and now Prague can actually play Rook D5 which is a good move which keeps the king cut off here or he can play C3 and this is very important uh moment he plays Pawn to C3 and now the pawn is sort of moving down the board so you need to go Rook C6 to stop it uh and and that would be an important move for Fabi he is thinking he goes Rook C6 and now you don't go to goody five Rook D5 is a massive blunder because after A6 Rook A5 King E3 the king comes and stops the pawn the move here is the very powerful Rook A7 pragnananda finds it Rook A7 is a classy move A5 is hanging and Fabi can save the pawn with playing Pawn to A6 but after C2 the pawn is about to Queen and when white takes the pawn Rook takes A6 is hanging A6 played and now very natural for Prague to push his C Pawn down the board he does it the white king can no longer stop this Pawn so he takes Rook take C2 and after Rook takes A6 now we reach a new end game now many experienced players would have known that there is a famous game between picket Kasparov here four versus three where actually garika Sparrow lost with the three pawns however this position pragnananda has a lot of time it's a classical game it's not a Blitz game and he will be able to hold this this is not a tough one to hold and he goes back King G8 one of the plants that trucks should be planning to do is to go H5 and sort of make his Pawn structure very strong on the other hand The Rook can be placed here stopping E6 move or it can go down and start creating threats here Rook D7 played by Fabi of course karwana has all the right in the world to play and continue fighting for the full point but objectively Prague is fine check now where do you play the king one is you can go back and it's not so silly because you want to play F4 and then maybe get your king out from the other side but karwana goes King E4 but when you play King E4 now actually Prague can create some play with Rook A2 attacking the F2 Pawn he goes Rook A1 very interesting choice by prop is a move like E6 dangerous well it could be but if you take here and then the king tries to enter this way but Rook q1 check just kind of is clean so your H4 played by Fabi and Prague response back with H5 gaining some space how should White make any plans here he goes F3 and maybe karwana has this idea in mind which is to play G4 take take and create an edge passer that is what he wants to do and pragnananda is not really impressed he gives a check and he tells Fabi that your king doesn't have anywhere to hide but karwana brings his Rook back and now Prague plays Rook 2 A3 he's attacking here he's tied up the white king and then after King F4 now King comes up up to G7 well karwana now has to do something active because he doesn't have too many plans he goes G4 he breaks on the kingside truck takes the pawn H takes G4 and it has to be recaptured F takes G4 plane the only kind of winning plan that white could have is go King G5 Rook D7 and maybe try for E6 that seems like the logical plan or you go H fight takes takes King F5 sort of deflect the king and try to win the F4 that could be another plan but Prague is very alert he goes through K5 and he doesn't really he keeps an eye on the E Pawn H5 played and the more pawns that are getting traded the more the game is moving towards the draw GTX H5 karwana has to take and now Prague has a very very direct way to hold a draw here he can keep waiting with Rook A6 or K1 or all these moves but he goes F6 classy move very classy if you take here I can take back and the H Pawn is going nowhere and if you give a check I can go King f8 and then when you take I can take this H5 Pawn so karwana kind of tries to improve a bit ego's H6 check well Prague could actually take the pawn and he does so King takes because he sees that if you play uh pondix Pawn then King G6 and you lose this Pawn but he has this move Rook D6 interesting move played by karwana pinning the pawn here King comes back to G7 and once the king comes in front of the pawn it would be a drop but after Rook F6 he's cut the king off so still Prague has to be very careful here because if white can get his Rook down the board and then the pawn pushes up there could be Lucena positions Happening Here Rook A1 King F5 played now Prague can wait he's being very careful he plays his Rook to A2 and he's just hanging there could check from this side could check from the other side so he's just waiting he's just waiting here Rook goes to B6 and the point of this move now of course is to give a check here that's the most important point but the way in which Prague defends now is something we can all learn from first he goes King F7 check here and now you need to put your king in front of the pawn so King E8 makes a lot of sense or he goes King f8 which is also fine which is also good now if you go King E6 there is check from the other side so he goes King F6 and now if you give a check from A6 there is E6 so you have to give a check from F2 and after King E6 was played here now the important move here very very critical to know it so that you can draw this with ease is the move Rook E2 this move would be a very strong move and I I would like to explain to you why and once Prague makes that move if if he is going to it's called the advanced filletor the point is that if I give you a check let's say you come here and I move my king I'll then go to F7 and you can no longer play E6 check so he's first given a check King G7 and now if King D6 there is King F7 and there's no way to check because I placed my Rook there that's the important point he goes rookie it and he tells Prague that I want to go here and then push because my Rook defends but truck says you've given up your long side and I'm going to check from the sides now so again important you stay behind the pawn here or you stay on the sides he gives rook d8 and now actually Prague can go back to E2 because if you give a check he may block with his Rook it's quite possible so not to be too creative just go behind the pawn Rook D1 played and he's hoping to somehow cut the king off maybe from F1 maybe from giving a check there so Prague has to once again be careful he goes King f8 he finds the good defense because if you give a check I'm coming to E8 here the king is well placed in front of the pawn so Fabi also you can see knows that um pragnananda knows how to hold this end game he goes for a check and Prague now well King King G8 E8 both are fine but King E8 is fine technique you stay in front of the passer King E8 and now karwana can threaten a mate in one by bringing his Rook here to the check and important now is to go to the short side this is the short side because the pawn cuts the board into two sides this is the long side this is the short side King f8 is good because the reason why King f8 is good is because the King goes to the short side The Rook can go to the long side to give checks rookie one still waiting so that's the point whenever uh such a position comes keep the Rook behind the pawn check King goes to G7 and we know the drawing method if King D6 there is King F7 and that's the point he goes King D6 and what's the move now Prague knows it beforehand that's the reason why he was playing this defense all along King F7 played and now it's no longer E6 coming with a check because I can take back with the check so he goes Rook A5 and now gives a check and Fabi puts the rook in but this is an admission of uh sort of truce you're going to draw the game takes takes karwana kind of pressed really hard there but Prague has defended excellently and now this game would end in a draw King E6 King goes back and he takes the pawn and a great great game by both these fighters who have played really well karwana pressing Prague defending first game ends in a draw now Prague will have white pieces what was very very nice to see was both of them analyzing after the game for nearly seven to eight minutes trying to get the thoughts of their opponent and in the end um I think the fair play officer came and said that they both need to come to do the fair play checks drug as always puts his score sheet and I think he'll also arrange the board because that's how he he likes to do uh sets up the board pieces the fair play officer is actually waiting for him there and says leave it leave it but of course Prague wants to keep it all in order foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music]"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

pragnananda comes in generally he carries with him a banana and he is here the youngster who's played phenomenally well in this tournament the first classical game between them ended in a draw this is the second one and if it's a decisive game whoever wins it goes through to the finals and if it's a draw they go into tie breaks Prague has the white pieces Fabi the extremely experienced current world number two and former World Championship Challenger Prague The Prodigy who's taken the Chess World by strong storm in this tournament and we have the Indian Ambassador in Azerbaijan Mr sridharan who makes the first move Prague thanks him for his wishes and we are ready to rock and roll here handshake and off we go Prague as always takes his time before the game that's a ritual that he has kind of made it his own in this event Fabi gets off his jacket some players prefer to play without the jacket but Prague keeps it on and I often wonder what chess players think during this moment of silence that they have before the game is it something like I really want to win the game or is it like that just centering themselves and trying to understand what is it how is it that they feel of course the opening that they're going to play has been prepared thoroughly a day before the game and also for many many hours before it Prague has already spent close to a minute on the clock and he is ready to go he goes one D4 and karwana responds instantly with Knight F6 and Prague plays his Pawn up to C4 E6 played generally at this level we are seeing that Queen's Gambit declined is the norm that these players play with the pawn up to Define that's exactly what karwana has done and Prague plays his Pawn to G3 he's going for the Catalan and he's his opening now resembles that of top players G3 is what you see at the highest level and karwana pauses a bit because it was also possible for Prague to play Knight to C3 here he goes G3 Bishop comes out to E7 and now Bishop G2 Fabi Castle's here and Prague also Castle so we have the standard position of the Catalan you can go for the closed Catalan with C6 but you can also go for the open one with dtec C4 Fabi takes on C4 which is the most common move Queen C2 Prague wants to chop this Pawn here and now A6 is the common move here also there is B5 which is a sharp line but A6 played by karwana and either you can take here or you can play A4 Prague goes for the A4 move to stop the pawn coming to B5 because then you take take and The Rook is hanging here so that's the reason why this is played and you're playing against this bishop on C8 which is slightly passive and that's the reason why karwana instantly goes Bishop D7 he wants to put his Bishop on C6 on this diagonal Prok takes the pawn on C4 and now Bishop comes out to C6 the bishop is ideally placed here Bishop to F4 this is all well known Theory and now the main move here that karwana plays is Bishop D6 offering a trade of Bishops and Prague comes back Queen C1 his point is if you were to take Bishop takes Bishop he would take with his Queen and that's a the reason why he came back the main move in this position is now A5 and we've had some games with A5 Knight C3 Knight comes here settles down on the B4 square and it's pretty Sharp H6 played by karwana here and this has very few games played before and you can see how pragnananda now in our time lapse is actually a little bit confused or you can say he's trying to recollect it's not on top of his head what he should do and he plays the move Rook E1 to tell you the truth this is only played once dingler and played this muruki one against Levon aronian and so there was another game Rook D1 that was played at the highest level but rookie one has been ding's choice and the point is you want to go Knight C3 and try for E4 and now you can see even Fabi does not remember or recollect what to do here after nearly 10 minutes of thought he takes the Knight on F3 makes sense and Prague would take back generally when you give up this bishop you want to then put your Pawn on C6 but that would lead to a passive position so he first takes on F4 it's very interesting what karwana is doing here and now Queen takes F4 and a bit confusing is if you play the move C6 here after Knight A3 Knight C4 looking at these squares white is clearly better so you don't want to play the move C6 but then this Pawn is hanging and Fabi shows his plan he's going Knight C6 attacking the spawn now the first thought that comes to mind is why can't we just take on C6 because once you take Pawn takes Rook C1 this is already looking very good however black can go for Rook B8 and this is the compensation you get for these double pawns on the B file it's active and you can see Prague taking a lot of time on the clock this is a very sharp sort of variation that can happen here uh but clearly Bishop takes Knight is the best move in the position Prague has thought for more than 15 minutes here and now finally he has to make a decision what to do Bishop C6 Knight C3 is another option do you want to go Rook D1 but Rook D1 is met with E5 he goes Knight A3 and that is not a good move he's actually made a mistake here and now karwana has this very very nice idea which is to play Knight takes D4 hit the bishop which Prague has of course seen Bishop takes Pawn here Bishop A6 and now comes the killer move which Prague may have missed E5 what a move this is because after Queen takes you go Rook E8 and now the queen does not have squares because if you go to C5 I already like there are Knight B3 ideas if you go to A5 there is still Knight B3 and if you go back to F4 I have G5 pushing you back Queen C1 and now you can Fork it here with Knight B3 but also Knight G4 and amazing move looking at E2 Square looking at Queen F6 F2 the queen will attack the bishop and this is actually winning position for black so all that karwana has to calculate is Knight D4 Bishop B7 Rook B8 Bishop A6 and E5 Pawn sacrifice but it's not an easy move to calculate especially with Prague sort of Behaving so confidently and he has played so well in the tournament can karuana do it he thinks for 17 minutes and then goes for the moo G5 this is not the best move but it is the second best move in the position so pretty good there by karwana and now Prague has to move his Queen away and so he plays it Queen takes E3 uh Queen to E3 and now black well now Knight D4 isn't that powerful because after Bishop B7 Rook B8 Bishop A6 there's no E5 gaining Tempo here so this position is fine now for Prague so the best move now is to take on D4 with the queen and that's exactly what Fabi does he takes the pawn and now pragnananda can chop that pawn uh chop that Queen off which he does Queen takes Knight takes attacking the bishop the bishop is going to take the pawn on B7 he does it Bishop takes B7 attacking The Rook now if Rook B8 there is Bishop takes A6 and although black has good play after Rook B2 this a pawn looks dangerous and that's the reason why karuana goes Rook a seven and not Rook B8 prak comes back with his Bishop to G2 now the material is even black spawns are also a little bit split but the biggest problem here which karwana shows with his next move is this weakened B Pawn and also the B3 square and the B4 Square The Rook is ready to come in the Knight is ready to come here and white is in massive massive trouble actually Rook D1 and Prague is ready to give up material because if Knight E2 King F1 Rook B2 there is Knight C4 hitting the Rook Rook C2 and it's an instant draw so that's the reason why Prague is like okay Fab if you want to take this be my guest but karwana has a very nice move either you can go Knight B3 but also just cementing the knight in the center with C5 and he plays it you can Bank on Fabi to grind this position to the fullest Prague is worse and he has a passive position and he has to be very very careful here with 39 minutes on the clock 54 minutes for Fabi how does pragnananda continue here because his B2 Pawn is hanging well if you one idea is to kick the Knight away with E3 and maybe that's the best move he plays his Pawn to E3 now this Knight can actually go to B3 that's exactly what Fabi does and I would expect Prague to go Rook A2 because the point is after Rook B4 when he attacks here you can defend it this way but Prague actually plays Rook B1 and The Rook is very passive because both these squares are controlled by the Knight Rook B4 comes in and he's attacking this Pawn how does Prague defend it it's actually not at all easy because if you push your Pawn to A5 the Knight can simply take it so that's not possible Prague goes Rook D3 and his point is that if you take here I will take your knight so that's not possible and if you play C4 then I will take this take this and take this which is fine for me so Fabi now needs to figure out how to continue he goes Rook C7 although Rook D7 would have been a better move to exchange this active rook and play could have gone something like this but instead he goes Rook C7 and maybe somewhere his plan is C4 but prague's next move is a classy one Bishop F1 and he plays against C4 because once you play this I take Rook takes Rook takes here Rook takes and Bishop takes and white is better so Prague being very resourceful in his defense Fabi now going King G7 so that at a later Point there's no Rook d8 check Tempo that can be gained and Prague now has to figure out again what to do he goes Rook to D1 still the A4 Pawn cannot be picked up because of Rook B3 still C4 is not possible because of the Knight C4 trick so karwana's next Plant clearly is to bring this Knight into the game he brings Knight D5 now very good move he blocks the D file the pressure is mounting on on uh pragnananda Fabi moves away from the board Prague has 16 minutes 15 minutes on the clock karuana has 32 minutes you still have to make 15 moves to reach Moon number 40 but drugs next move here very cool E4 he's trying to gain counter play once again the pawn is of limits you take here you lose your knight so the Knight has to move but actually karwana's plan was this all throughout he wanted to provoke E4 so that he gets the D4 Square for his Knight on B3 once imagine the Knight sits there on D4 look at how weak the B2 and A4 pawns are so Prague now after E4 has made a move which is positionally dubious and so has to play very very sharp chess Knight C2 excellent move hitting the Rook Now The Rook has to move back if you go Rook B6 there is Rook D6 ideas attacking A6 Pawn so he goes Rook B7 and what does Prague do now he his E4 Pawn is a little loose he goes Bishop G2 and he tells Fabia my plan is E5 and if you come here I'll take your knight so he's creating a lot of tactical play in this position and karwana goes Knight G4 he's angling for 95 Pawn to C4 and then cementing his Knight on the D3 square that would be really really tough for Prague to deal with and but Prague plays E5 this is the thing about this youngster he always keeps finding tactical resources he's he's hitting the Rook on B7 and he's gained some space but also he has had to calculate Knight takes E5 because his own Rook would be attacked there 95 and takes the pawn well Prague has to take the Rook on B7 and that's what he does he takes the Rook karwana takes the Rook as well and now B2 is hanging so Prague takes your and the important point to note is you can't take here because after Rook B1 you are losing one of the two knights so what do you do next here you go C4 and now B2 is hanging because if this Falls C3 is coming in Prague continues his tactical prowess here he takes on C4 because if Rook takes C4 you have Rook takes and here's the key point that if you go Knight C1 I still have Rook D2 so that's fine so after Bishop C4 Fabi could have taken here but there was still Rook B1 but instead he takes on F2 and now you can simply take back King takes F2 and while I did do think that this game is heading towards a draw there's a big problem that truck faces Knight is hanging Pawn is hanging and this is Moon number 34 he six minutes to figure out well you couldn't go into the variation if you hadn't seen the next Moon Knight A1 fantastic move played by pragnananda because if you take here he will take the Knight and if you take the Knight then I get a rook behind the pawn which is very important here so he goes Knight to C5 and this is prague's idea again which is to play Pawn to B3 the Knight on A1 is terrible it's passive but it's supporting this entire construction which is giving white good play on The Queen side Rook B4 played attacking the pawn on B3 and now Prague cannot go Rook B1 because that is Knight A4 and he cannot go rogudi 3 because the Knight controls it so he needs to find a way to continue the game and he finds it King E3 excellent move so if root Knight takes B3 there is Rook A1 Rook B1 pinning here and so that's a very very important tactical resource F5 played by Fabi and he's saying now my threat is to take if you go Rook B1 to pin me here I have a check to the king and my knight is unpinned here on B3 so Prague goes King D2 and he says to Fabi be my guest take this Pawn if you like but I will come King C3 and once again you will be in trouble so that's the reason why King D2 was played goes F4 it's a full-fledged race here 37th move we have three more moves to go first Prague brings this King into the position attacking The Rook The Rook will move back he goes back and now if you are not accurate and you go King C4 you are in trouble after Rook C8 very strong move so Prague finds GTX F4 first GTX F4 and now the 40th move Before Time control he must play the move A5 which is a strong move he plays it he finds A5 and he finds it with two seconds on the clock he looks at Fabi score sheet that 40th move is coming to an end and then gets up from his chair karwana makes 94 move and now it's a check now look at this if you go King C4 then the problem is F3 F2 Rook going to F1 there's a fork here so you can't plan so Prague actually in deep thought what to do you can't go to the D file as well King D3 is met with Knight F2 King D4 with Rook d8 so he needs to go to B2 and he's already spent 15 minutes on the clock and finds King to B2 and now Pawn up to F3 now the Knight comes out to C2 and pawn pushes forward with F2 so karwana pushes his spawn here and this is getting very very dangerous for Prague he needs to find his own play and he needs to stop this Pawn because Knight D2 is also a threat so he goes Rook F1 now important to note that after take take check King B4 Knight F1 A6 Knight comes out I have Knight E3 stopping the pawn so that is completely fine you can't take this and win here so one way to play this position and I was analyzing King G6 A6 King G5 Knight B4 very important resource you can't take the Knight because there is A7 and I queen so you have to go King G4 then I come back King F3 now I take take A7 Rook A8 and Rook A1 and this is a very good chance for draw because B4 B5 B6 but clearly the most natural idea in this position is to bring your king up this is the most natural idea for karwana and uh is taking his time which is the correct strategy here that he must think but for sure I mean for Prague it's a very tough situation after King comes up because he has to find many accurate moves but karwana plays E5 and this is slightly surprising because now Prague pushes his Pawn forward and he asks karwana what are you doing now Knight comes back to C5 attacking the pawn and the Knight goes to B4 very good move he defends it because now if you take your A7 is already winning here so that's the reason why he plays Rook A8 but now this is an admission of maybe not defeat but saying that okay my Pawn here on F2 I didn't believe in it I can actually give it up and now Prague can take it with his Rook he takes it Rook takes F2 played and now after Knight takes on A6 you can just take it and The Rook end game is a draw if you take take this is an easy draw pragnananda in fact about to make his move and he plays Knight C6 and offers a draw interesting and karwana instantly accepts it and that ends the game what a fight that was again karwan uh their Prague shaking his head he had to defend throughout in fact in both the classical games he has had to defend tenaciously against karwana's pressure but the youngster has managed to do it and forced the match to go into tie breaks where they will play two games of 25 plus 10 rapid two games of 10 plus 10 rapid then two games of five plus three I mean if everything remains equal and then you have the sudden death both players arranging the pieces there's going to be a toss which will happen to determine who gets the white pieces in the first rapid game and there you have the Arbiter doing the toss he takes two Pawns in his hands and he puts it behind and maybe he'll ask one of the players to choose he asks karwana karwana has the white pieces in the first rapid game of 25 plus 10 this will be very exciting we'll see if pragnananda manages to again beat karwana and reach the finals just like he beat Hikaru will Prague manage to do that and there you have the fair play officer in the distance telling both the players that we need to check you and uh I hope you enjoyed the game [Music] [Applause] thank you"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

we are into the rapid play Prague opens the game with one E4 and Magnus responds with E5 Knight comes out to F3 and Magnus willigo Knight C6 yes he does he plays his night out to C6 and truck plays his favorite Italian with Bishop to C4 Knight comes out to F6 and now D3 a very solid system bolstering the center Magnus develops his Bishop out on a good square and Prague place this slightly lesser known line with Pawn up to A4 he wants to gain Queen side space and Magnus plays Pawn to D6 Prague castles it out and now will Magnus Castle as well well he plays his Pawn up to A5 and tells Prague you're not getting all the space there on the queen side Prague offers the trade of the bishop Bishop takes Pawn takes now white has doubled pawns but the f file is open Magnus castles and truck quickly brings his Knight to D2 look at truck's time he's already up to 26 minutes almost Magnus down to 22 minutes he plays his Knight to E7 he wants to play C6 D5 or reroute his Knight to G6 and Prague goes Knight H4 the Knight is in an attacking position but Magnus brings this Pawn up to C6 what does Prague do next Queen E1 the plan is to bring the queen to G3 and keep pressure on the king side Magnus pushes his Pawn to D5 now if you take here then white black would have a very strong Center so Prague goes back and now taking here is not a good idea because there's a lot of pressure on F7 that's the reason why Magnus plays his Queen up to D6 but now Queen G3 pinning the pawn here putting pressure here there are threats of playing D4 in the air so Magnus quickly attacks the queen and asks it to move from that square now the queen is attacked the queen can actually go to G5 and it does it attacks the Knight now Magnus can either move back his Knight or push his Pawn forward he does that Knight F3 is a great move because you keep the pressure in the center and later break with D4 will plug find it no he plays his Knight forward it looks very aggressive because it attacks the queen and also the pawn is pinned here however it's not a good move the advantage for truck has been lost it takes F5 and he felt that he still has some attacking chances here because of the pawn coming up to F6 but but King G7 is such a classy move it stops F6 because now there are three controls here Prague brings this King to H1 and now another beautiful move Queen F6 you can't avoid the trade of Queens because after Knight F5 E4 there's this Knight E34 Magnus has seen this and truck has to trade the queens and after Knight takes F6 black is out of the woods the position is now still around equal maybe very slightly better for Magnus but plug's Advantage is nowhere to be seen E4 played Now Pawn pushes forward Magnus can play play Rook 88 keeping the center strong no he takes now taking here is not a great option the reason is that after Pawn takes is given up the C4 Square for the Knight and now the Knight can put pressure on the A5 Pawn as we'll see later in the game Rook 88 hits the Knight here on D2 Prague can just move his Rook up and he does it defends the Knight and plans to double The Rook on the f file this is still a very complex end game you can say middle game queenless middle game position Rook to D4 putting pressure on the E4 Pawn Prague brings his Rook here so that if the Knight moves F7 Falls Knight goes back to G8 and now he pushes The Rook back slowly and steadily Prague is gaining control over the position Rook goes back to D7 and now Prague defends the E4 Pawn so that his Knight can actually start to move now he plays Rook E7 and Knight C4 would be very very powerful because it attacks the A5 Pawn First Prague wants to defend his E4 Pawn so he goes Bishop C2 and Magnus brings his Knight to D7 his idea is also to place his Knight on this active Square well but prague's Knight goes there first magnus's Rook goes to defend the pawn and now Prague goes G4 not at all a good move because it weakens everything Knight gf6 is the best move here but Magnus plays F6 and that is not so great because now Prague goes Rook G2 his idea is to play G5 and create weaknesses in the position Knight goes to H6 and now G5 would be very good suddenly Prague is once again pressing here with the white pieces he pushes this is such an important game because the one who would win this would get a huge amount of advantage in This World Cup finals Rook G3 is a good move here but he goes Rook G2 maybe not the best place for The Rook but these are very subtle points which are very difficult to consider rookie 6 played and now after Rook D2 attacking the night Magnus finds a brilliant muruk F6 because now if you take the Knight The Rook is hanging and if you take the Rook the Knight will take it with this what he has managed to do is reduce prague's pressure to some extent and exchange one pair of Rooks the queen side pawns get traded and now Magnus goes King f8 he's starting to feel that his Knights have a lot of potential especially the F4 square is weak Prague brings his King up to G2 Magnus brings his King to the center he very clearly understands where his pieces belong Pawn to A5 Prague is trying to put pressure on these pawns and he has that more space on the queen side but Magnus shifts his attention to the king side The Rook is actively placed Prague goes passive his Rook was on an open file he now plays a passive move Magnus goes on the attack he's threatening a fourth year with Knight F4 check and time wise Prague is only 14 seconds Magnus has two minutes 36 seconds the King goes back to G1 the Knight Moves In Black is suddenly taking over the initiative Prague has to be careful Rook comes out 2x3 now Bishop D1 very important move to keep control over the position but he blunders with A6 Prague had very little time on the clock and after takes here prague's idea is Bishop A4 Knight F5 tried to attack the C6 Pawn that is that's exactly what he does but what he has missed is that after Rook C3 attacking the Knight Knight A5 this Knight is already in a great position the other Knight joins in and with this three pieces the white king is toasted you can see that Prague is a bit surprised he's actually shocked that his position is so bad now Knight H3 check and this is all over King cannot go back here on H1 because of the same reason that he goes to F1 Rook A3 attacking the bishop if the bishop moves Rook A1 is Checkmate and so he takes with the Knight with a check King goes up the bishop is hanging a check look at how the Knight controls all the squares Prague resigns Magnus Carlsen wins The all-important Clash what a game that was it was equal almost for 95 of the game but in the end Magnus showed his brilliance that's why he's called the god of endgame [Music] foreign

World Champion vishan makes his way to the tournament Hall he takes off his jacket places it on the chair and takes his seat he's playing at the levito chess week 2023 in Amsterdam and vishy adjusts his pieces he likes to do it with both his hands which is quite rare in the world of Chess where Everyone likes to adjust with one hand wishi waits for his oppon opponent he's taking on the amazing leevon aronian aronian comes in also places his jacket on the chair starts the clock and off we go vishi plays 1 E4 and Levon responds with the Sicilian Knight to F3 Pawn up to D6 is it going to be a knorf pawn takes Knight takes the pawn and Leon plays Knight F6 now playing sharp lines against wishi is is always dangerous but Leon does it because wishi is so well prepared but now is Wishy as well prepared as he was back in the day when he was right at the top let's see Knight to B3 and Leon trying to decide what would be his next move here Bishop E6 played and now Anand places his Bishop on E3 a typical idea to play Queen D2 and put your King on C1 long Castle Bishop comes out to E7 and vishy now goes Queen D2 this is going to be an exciting game because black is going to go short castles while white is going to go long castles that's what Leon does and exactly what wishi does now black is going to start his play on The Queen side with B5 B4 and white is going to play with G5 G4 G5 let's see what wishi does here yes yes he goes Pawn up to G4 and now Leon must also start his play he also plays B5 the most common move here is G5 and is Anand going to play that no he goes Rook G1 now this is an innovation that vishi himself had played back in the day in 2006 with morich with Van welli in 2007 so he knows all about it Rook G1 is kind of a waiting move there Knight comes to A5 and now looking at the C6 square a useful waiting move on the G file it can open up someday Queen to C7 stopping Knight C6 and I think Wishy now can push his Pawn to G5 is he going to do that yes he does Pawn up to G5 nice little move there and what is Leon going to play here yes yes Knight to H5 that's a good Square for the Knight and white has to decide now how to continue because this bishop needs to develop but wishi says that's something that I'll do later he first puts his Knight on D5 Knight takes Pawn takes attacks the bishop a common idea is to go Bishop F5 the bishop is well placed there but then the Knight could settle down on the C6 square and that's the reason why Leon goes back to D6 s the way in which the pieces are placed on the king side it's not so easy to start rolling your pawns especially with this Knight on H5 so wishi goes King B1 and now notice this plan what is he planning he's planning to actually break open the position with C4 so leevon goes G6 maybe at some point he wants the Knight to come back into the game via G7 or maybe he wants to even break with F6 but wishi goes and plays on The Queen side this is the thing with top players they can play on the entire board be it on the king side or the queen side Now Pawn to C4 is a nice move Leon brings his Rook to C8 trying to put pressure down the C file also at some point Bishop F5 check can come in but the king will tuck itself in on the A1 Square where it will be very safe Rook comes to C1 notice how this Knight is actually clogging everything up on the queen side now Leon after great thought pushes his Pawn to B4 and you can see there vishy just adjusts himself in the chair he knows this is a free Pawn but what is up on Leon's mind is the question why is he giving him a free Pawn well he takes it and Leon shows his hand he plays Bishop d8 attacking the Knight the Knight has to move back and then the pawn pushes forward first hitting the queen then hitting the Knight and I think that is what Leon aronian wants but wishi has to now play his Knight back and he's thinking a bit and he does it Knight comes to B3 Pawn pushes forward is this sufficient compensation for black for the missing Pawn Anand plays his Queen to C3 another nice little move now all that vishi has to do in some ways is to ensure that Leon does not get too much counterplay also the Knight can reroute itself to the E4 Square so check first now notice this little trick that Leon has if you play Bishop D3 he's going to play Queen C4 the bishop is pinned here and cannot take the queen so Anand has to be careful here and he goes King A1 nice he's sharp he's alert and he plays his King to the side Leon pushes his Pawn further but that's exactly what wishi wanted he now goes to D2 and once his Knight settles on the E4 Square it will be a powerful piece and white can also push forward with the mo C5 Leon is struggling to create counterplay he offers his Queen for trading but that's not what you do when you're material down wishi would be more than happy to exchange queens and I think Queen takes A5 is a fine move but he play Knight E4 which is also a nice move Pawn takes and now Leon is a clear Pawn down Knight F4 do you want to take this Knight generally you don't want to because firstly it'll create an opposite colored Bishop position secondly the Knight on F4 does look good but it's not doing much it's dominated by the bishop on F1 so vishy picks up the queen and now do you take with the bishop or The Rook Leon takes a bit of time takes it with the Rook trying to stop the move C5 because that's the most dangerous move in the position how does wishi make progress is the next question what do you do here first oh Anand was a bit hesitant there and pushes his Pawn to A3 hm is his idea in some ways to put his Bishop on D2 and then reroute it to B4 Rook B8 played by Leon but has he allowed to move C5 here do you do that I think wish he wanted to move his Rook but now suddenly watches sees that there's an opportunity to push the pawn to C5 because the Rook was actually protecting this square and why did Leon move it away is a is a big question and yes Anand pushes Pawn to C5 vishi does not miss such chances take on C5 and now you can take with the bishop or The Rook both moves seem possible and Anand is actually looking at what to do black might want to come in with his Rook here and attack the bishop but you know you can simply move the bishop away at that point he takes Rook takes C5 nice move there trading the Rooks Rook comes in to B3 and now if you take I mean if he had taken he would have taken with the bishop but now the bishop is attacked so what do you do I like how Anand calmly takes his time before every move plays his Rook to C3 and again a fantastic move because if you take I take with the pawn and slowly I will have two connected pawns Leon takes Pawn takes Bishop E7 attacking this Pawn on A3 but notice how this bishop has not at all moved in the game but still plays such an important role because it controls all all these squares of Knight and Rook amazing piece there Bishop on F1 King comes up to G7 well Leon is trying to create some play but vy's pawns are so vicious they are coming down the board Pawn to C4 okay one problem is that you can't push C5 because it's firmly guarded so how does wishi make progress here is the question first H6 by Leon Anan takes it King takes and now this next move by vishi is going to be a pure Class Act because see the Bishop can't engineer C5 here so he goes Bishop D2 he changes his tracks and he's going to go to B4 and then push C5 isn't that simply amazing play Rook goes back Bishop comes in and F5 Leon is moving quickly because he hardly has any time left on the clock it's 5sec increment per move but now vishi can start pushing his pawns he goes first D6 Bishop moves away C5 he doesn't care about his E4 Pawn because his Pawn in the center are just too strong F takes E4 Leon is very tricky so vishy has to play carefully but these two pawns are so strong that there's absolutely no way that black can create any counterplay here he goes Knight to D5 attacking the bishop does wishi keep pushing his pawns here well he's planning to finally move his Bishop on move number 41 the bishop moves up attacks the Knight it has been an amazing piece now attacking the bishop there Bishop moves into E6 and aronian is pushing his Pawn to E3 well the idea could be to play E2 Bishop H4 and try to control this queening square but vishy has it firmly guarded with his bishop and Rook here and now he pushes his Pawn to C7 next move could be D7 at the right time right now or even C8 Queen because the square is guarded by the bishop he goes E4 with a check King comes to C2 and Anan picks up the queen that's always a very nice thing you see it at school level you see it at World Championship level players love to just keep their Queen it's also a subtle statement to their opponent that they are winning Rook G4 classy move attacking the bishop and the pawn Leon resigns he really didn't have a chance in that game wishi played a close to Flawless game there he knew all the opening ideas he knew what to do after Rook G1 he played this fantastic Rook C1 and pawn to C4 you can see how he analyzes really with great interest Wesley so comes in to also watch that analysis Anand taking on some of the best players in the world of Chess even at this age of 53 and really showing them how it's done fantastic chess by vishi there and Leon of course has had a wonderful tournament here he has won many games he was actually in the lead however with this loss vishi has relegated him down to the second spot and look at that they are analyzing still and yeah vishi has won a great game there"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

of two candidates tournaments Yan nepom Nishi it's going to be a clash of generations as well as a clash between two top players in the world of Chess Yan gets his pieces ready vishy is all ready for the battle it's at the levitov chess week 2023 happening in Amsterdam we are all set to go and there we are handshake 10 minutes plus 5 Seconds increment and nepo opens the game with 1 D4 now vishy brings his Knight out to F6 taking the center further with C4 Knight to C3 will Anand go for the nimzo no he chooses the very solid Queen's Gambit declined and you can see there nepo thinking of his different options he takes Pawn takes and Bishop to G5 this is a very very popular way to play against the qgd which is known as the kbad structure for white vishy brings his Bishop out to E7 and nepo now has a few options the main one is of course to put his Bishop on D3 and he does that Bishop D3 on the board vishi pushes the bishop to a with H6 and you can see that nepo looking on the other side trying to recollect his theory Bishop H4 played and now Anand can go Knight D7 that is one idea in this position he can also Castle but generally black doesn't Castle so soon but he does it the reason I thought was that now white can go Queen C2 long castle and try to attack on the king side with H3 G4 well but Anand has something other on his mind he goes Knight H5 offering a trade of the Bishops Queen takes and nepo quickly castles on the king side he doesn't think about Queen inside castling there okay now a very simple plan that white would have in this position is to somehow defend this pawn and engineer the F3 E4 breakthrough meanwhile black will try to meet F3 with the Moose C5 that's a very common knee-jerk reaction and also Anand continues developing he puts his Knight on D7 generally in such structures Rook B1 B4 B5 is also played it's called the minority attack but nepo goes for completely different plan he is like I have not developed my queen which generally belongs on C2 so I'm going to put it on D2 and defend the pawn on E3 so that I can play F3 next that seems to be his plan here Anand brings back his Knight in good position on F6 and one thing you will see in this game quite a lot is how wishi reshuffles his pieces to their good squares nepo goes F3 and his I idea is E4 if you go Rook E8 trying to attack the E3 Pawn most likely he will play E4 here Anan now has to be careful because not only is E4 an idea but also G4 Knight G3 and trying to gain space on the king side so he instantly meets it with a strike in the center with C5 and as we said C5 is a knee-jerk reaction to the F3 move in such structures but one thing that is a bit Troublesome for Anand is his Bishop on C8 it's not developed yet and the pawn on D5 could become weak how does nepo continue here you can see him thinking and he is maybe planning o he brings his Rook I was wondering if he wants to already start expanding with G4 and start pushing his pawns he goes Rook A1 centralizes his rook and now bishy needs to decide what to do next you can move your knight away to B6 that's one plan Anand goes rook d8 and interesting move because with the Rook he's defending his D5 Pawn but then where do you put your knight ah he wants to go to f8 wow and then move his Bishop that seems like the plan G4 played and let's see what vishi comes up with Neo's position does look more Flex ible easier to play for the time being Knight jumps to f8 a good Square for the Knight and look at how nepo brings his Knight to G3 but one more thing that the Knight on f8 is doing is not just protecting the queen king but also going to E6 to hit D4 and there you have the Knight comes to E6 but with that he's once again shut down this bishop this Knight is actually not helping The Bishop's cause in many ways and now white can actually jump with his Knight on F5 and place it there yes he puts his Knight on F5 on a very good Square attacking the Queen the queen moves to C7 and now how does nepo continue his attack because now his Pawn is well defended also it's impossible to kick the Knight because then you lose the6 Pawn so a lot of problems there for Wishy Bishop B1 played a nice little move the bishop moves away who knows the queen and Bishop can create a battery down this diagonal for wishi now it's also tough to actually figure out what moves need to be played one of them could be to take on D4 Pawn takes and make use of this F4 square that could be an idea quite possible but it opens up the E file for the rook and the Knight and that's not something that Anand wants to do you can see wishi calmly surveying the position and trying to see what are his possible options time wise nepo has close to 7 minutes on the clock what will vishy do next and you can already sense from the body language that nepo is feeling confident here vishi is not really feeling completely safe about his position and this is where experience comes in sometimes you can't find Moose and inexperienced players want to lash out they want to sort of do something in the position but vishi has years of experience on his side and he would like actually to keep improving his position minimally and one of the things that he must figure out is what to do with this bishop and the rook and that's the reason why he plays Bishop D7 now this might seem a nothing move for the time being but on the other hand it does connect the Rooks nepo needs to plan how does he attack he goes King H1 so logical he plays his Rook to G1 pushes his Pawn to F4 and then his Pawn to G5 and guys that would be a monstrous attack coming wishi anand's way so Anand plays Bishop C6 once again this is purely on field if you put your Bishop here opposite the king it will come in handy at some point is what V is thinking because now nepo can never take on C5 he has to maintain the pawn on D4 so that black cannot push his Pawn down the board but nepo has no such ideas of taking on C5 he says I'm anyway planning a kingside attack he goes H4 there and now vishy another improving mood taking the E file so this is again a very calm cool collected move he puts his Rook on E8 now there's no problems on the E 7 square and Anand can already think about taking on D4 and putting his Knight on F4 he does that c takes D4 e takes D4 and now you want to put your piece one of your pieces on this Square maybe Queen F4 also logical very interesting but then the queen is a little misplaced on this Square that's what one gets the feeling so Anand puts his Knight there which is very very good now the problem is for white that old already there are some exchanges happening down the E file so you cannot just go G5 Queen H2 played and nepo pin this Knight this way but now wishi very quickly exchanges a rook Rook takes and well I'm wait I think it's very likely he'll get his other Rook on E8 he's just thinking just hesitating a bit there but I think that is the logical move to bring your other Rook to E8 and once once the Rooks are traded off the board then Neo's attack may not really be so threatening because then uh you're only left with minor pieces now Yan nepom Nishi has a decision trade the Rooks give up on the attack or play Rook G1 keeping the Rooks but giving wishi the all important eile in the position well he goes Rook G1 this is taking a lot of risks and now wishi can actually play Bishop D7 hit this Knight or even h 5 which is a classy move in that position he goes Knight E6 and that is slightly passive because he wants to trade of the Queens but it's also practical Anand is like let's trade the Queens so that the attack no longer goes through Knight takes C7 and now nepo uh attacking chances are gone he's shaking his head there but the end game is still not so simple because here the bishop is a little bit restricted by the pawn the D5 Pawn is under pressure also G G5 is in the air but vishy is a master at defending such positions he goes Knight E6 and maybe now somewhere he is me angling for G6 let's see what nepo doeses he goes Rook to D1 he defends his Pawn here so that the Knight can start moving and Anand brings his King into the game a very very useful move in this game wishi has played several such moves where he has just minutely improved his position nepo also doing the the same bringing the king up to G3 and now actually G6 could be an idea because let's say G6 you take the pawn here King G7 the Knight is kind of sideline there but vishy goes Knight G8 very very interesting he defends the pawn wants to kick the Knight away and then maybe bring his Knight to E7 that could also be a plan but nian nepom Nishi there seems to have a plan to clamp down the king side structure and that happens very often with the move H5 that's exactly what he's done he's clammed down wishy's King side position Knight comes back to F6 he didn't actually trade the knights with Knight E7 he comes back to F6 now Bishop comes to C2 and maybe the bishop wants to pop out on B3 Anan goes Rook to C8 and nepo does put his Bishop on on B3 attacking the D5 Pawn it's attacked twice already and if one more piece comes here it will be attacked Thrice so Anan goes back to d8 Knight E3 has come in the position vishy says it's time to get some space back he plays his Pawn up to G6 and with this if nepo doesn't do anything then he's losing a Pawn on H5 so he has has to make a move but what exactly is it he takes Pawn takes and Anand has reclaimed some of his paace next he can bring his King up also G5 to clam down on the F4 square and H5 to create a passer so these are some of the ideas that vishi is playing with nepo now goes F4 he's still trying to push here he's still trying to fight for an advantage but I think a move like f uh G5 would be very strong but Hanan makes a error he goes King G7 and F5 played attacking the Knight on E6 wishi goes Knight to G5 and now takes the pawn on G6 believe it or not this king is in some trouble because the Knight is jumping here the bishop is coming back with a check and you have to be careful he takes King takes G6 Bishop C2 check you would love to bring your knight in here but no vishi actually goes King F7 back he doesn't want to trade TR those Knights and now nepo goes Knight F5 look at this White's position suddenly starting to get better amazing Knight attacking G H6 Pawn you you could play H5 here but no he goes here Rook h8 Rook E1 The Rook now threatens to enter with Rook E7 so many problems in this position how is vishi going to come out of this situation he goes H5 but it's a mistake the beautiful moon now is Rook E5 with the idea of Knight D6 and winning this Knight here it's not an easy move to find but can nepo play it no he takes on H5 and the position is back to equal vishy is now okay but he was in big trouble and you can see there he's a bit nervous he's a bit tensed nepo as always plays fast he looks confident Knight takes H5 King comes comes up to G4 attacking both the knights Knight comes to E6 vishi is now wanting to give the check with his other Knight and what does nepo do next now his King could also come under some pressure the only problem that Black Faces is Bishop is so passive it's doing absolutely nothing now a check to the king and wish he can move his King to E7 he has to otherwise he might lose this Knight okay he can also go to F6 where is he planning to go also nepo really would like to sort of fight for the advantage and not accept that this position is equal and dsh King E7 but there's nothing much to play play for he goes Bishop F5 and he attacks the pinned piece here but now wishi can actually bring his Knight back defend it and also attack the bishop that's what he does so now anan's position very solid the Knight is hanging on D6 so he's threatening to take it clearly the Knight doesn't have too many squares to go to so he goes Knight to B5 and now what does Anan do one plan is to take King takes and then Rook f8 check kicking the king away and then black is out of the woods so he takes King takes and plays check nepo should be very careful he should move his King back to G4 where it will have lot of space don't go to E5 it looks good no he goes there but now the king is trapped you can see the Knight can jump here you can see wishi is absolutely ready with his Moon Knight F4 Knight G6 is a mate Knight D3 is a mate and look at nepo there he is talking to himself he's so upset and he instantly shoots out his Moon Knight to D5 and smiles there because he is so unhappy there with what he has done his position was completely fine but he had to give up a piece in in order to save his King from getting checkmated now Rook G1 he's trying to play fast but his position looks bad will wish she managed to win this the only problem that one can feel in this position is the number of pawns are less white king is active White Knight is attacking here and white Rook is ready to enter so still practically there are some things to be done A6 played by Anand he brings his Knight to D6 also Yan is making his moves pretty quickly and he's putting a lot of pressure on Wishy you can see vishy vish's hand shaking a bit there King D7 Rook to G7 check King comes up to C6 and he goes back to G3 one important line that should be mentioned is Knight takes B7 is met with Knight D3 mate because now the bishop is defended so that's the reason why he goes to G3 Anand quickly chops off the pawn Pawn comes to B3 and now Bishop B1 played Rook to C3 check King B6 played by vishy two pawns each aside but Anand has an extra piece now a checked on C8 and wishi goes King to A5 he's slowly figuring out the plan here which is to move his King to B4 win the pawn and then start chugging these pawns down the board Knight D6 Pawn to B5 you can see there vishy also gaining in confidence there that he's going to convert this position often when you see wishi converting winning positions you might see him a bit shaky uh with his the way he makes his moves but actually he's very solid with uh with the moves that he's making here he gives a check Rook comes to A8 defending the pawn on A6 and now the idea of course is to come King B4 take the pawn and and start pushing his pawns down the board King to D7 nepo is trying to bring his King from the backside but anan's King is way quicker he goes King B4 King to C7 played and now wishi takes one of the pawns nepo will get back one of his pawns as well with King B7 because now the A6 Pawn cannot be defended but I think wishi can actually he goes Rook at8 can now calmly use his B Pawn to push it yes he goes B4 one Pawn is good enough there nepo now clearly having no real plans he should be in big big trouble here because also the D Pawn is not going anywhere he goes Rook a one attacking the bishop Anan moves his King in to defend the bishop and also um free one space for the pawn to come down Rook A5 played and he plays Pawn to B3 Rook G5 played by nepo and now the Knight comes back wishi is planning to put his Knight to block any side checks perhaps from here King up rook pins the Knight ooh nice move there King comes here Knight check and now King comes to D5 Knight F4 check the king is being moved around King to C6 but now that the Knight is pinned I think all that is needed is yes the bishop comes out next the king comes out and then the pawn pushes forward Rook to G4 and vishi is now ooh he's going to move his King yes he does and nepo resigns with a very gentl manly smile on his face very nice there by both the players nepo seemed to be doing quite well in the opening and early middle game but wish's defense was quite amazing at some point nepo also had a chance to win the game but Anand when he got his chance he simply pounced onto it and nepos King was not at all safe in the center uh it's very nice to see how both the players are analyzing nepo of course has great respect for Vish Anand he's mentioned that after he won one of the candidates tournaments and there the match has come to an end the game has come to an end in wishes favor"}, {"instruction":

brings out his Knight to F6 this is such a wonderful Clash of generations here between the legend of Indian chess Vish Anand and the absolute huge Talent nihal serin D5 and and now G3 nihal plays the Catalan opening against vishi and vishi simply takes the pawn one of the things that you will notice in this game is how nihal moves his pieces very carefully C5 castles and now vishi has to decide which line he's going for he plays his Knight to C6 and nihal takes the pawn on C5 this is an endgame line but it is very much in keeps with nihal's style he likes to press slightly better positions Bishop takes C5 and now he brings his Knight here trying to take the pawn on C4 when white would be better and that's the reason why wishi pushes the pawn gives it up but in return spoils the white structure slightly nihal takes it back and now Anand castles it out this is all well-known Theory and you can see the time of both players has risen to 26 minutes on the clock Bishop goes back to E7 Here and Now nihal pushes his Pawn he wants to put his Bishop on B2 Black's main problem is this bishop on C8 which vishi has now developed on D7 nihal goes Bishop B2 and the threat is to take here and maybe then chop off this bishop Anand plays his Rook to d8 defending the bishop and now the Knight jumps in putting pressure on C6 and unleashing this Bishop vishi defends it and now nihal plays his Knight to B5 you can see that he's well prepared Pawn to B6 notice you can win a pawn here but after Rook C6 Knight A7 the C4 Pawn is also under pressure and that's the reason why nihal goes Knight to D6 Bishop takes by Anand and now Rook takes D6 ensures that white has the bishop pair here but is it going to be enough against such an exp experienced player like Vish Anand Bishop E8 played and look at nihal he's still in his preparation he plays Rook D3 vishi is down to 22 minutes now Anand plays his Knight to B4 attacking The Rook nihal still takes it it's quite scary to play against a player who's so well prepared we are on move number 19 already Bishop C3 still prep oh amazing the Knight comes back but you know one thing you can't do to Anand is is scare him off because he has years of experience on his side now first move that nihal Tau for 6 minutes plays A4 Knight goes back to D7 and nihal pushes forward with A5 his threat is to take and attack this Knight so vishy takes advantage of the C5 Square which is an outpost for his Knights Knight takes and now you can take back with the Knight he takes it back Knight takes on C5 you will notice that in this position white should be very slightly better because he has the bishop pair he has a bishop on C3 and a bishop on G2 but what black has here is this Ultra solid Knight on C5 E3 played by ni look at the way in which he pushes his Pawn his idea is maybe to plon the bishop on the D4 Square Rook comes to C8 defending the Knight and also putting pressure on the C4 Point nihal plays his Bishop to F1 that's slightly passive move but what nihal is hoping for is now that the bishop defends this Pawn he can actually move his other Bishop to D4 Rook to B1 and put pressure on B6 he plays Rook to B1 and attacks the pawn on B6 Anan brings his Knight back defends it it's also quite impressive that actually nihal is trying for something in such a position against such an experienced opponent mind you nihal is not the Beast that he is today he's 2700 plus as on today but at that point he was just a Grandmaster rising up the ranks Bishop D4 played trying to attack the pawn on B6 now the bishop comes to E4 and attacks The Rook you need to move it where will the Rook go and here nihal plays his Rook to B4 and his threat is to take on B6 and maybe then have an extra Pawn in the position so Anand goes a bit passive he plays Rook to B8 and uh defends the pawn nihal now offers a trade of the bishop this is a small concession because you have the bishop pair but somehow anan's Bishop in the center was so strong King takes G2 and now Pawn up to F6 so vishy limiting the bishop on D4 and now getting ready to bring his King into the game E4 played by nihal and now Anand can fight back for the space that's what he does he pushes his Pawn to E5 and questions the bishop there on D4 the bishop has to move back to E3 and now Anan brings his King up King to F7 and uh nihal goes Pawn up to H4 nice move trying to clamp down the structure wish he can go actually he goes Rook C8 he could have actually played H5 and he was completely fine there but now H5 nihal again gains more space very interesting play e takes F4 and I think vishi has a very clear equalizing plan in mind after nihal takes the best moon now is to play G5 trade more pawns and he should be completely fine but vishi makes an error he plays F5 and this actually gives nihal a small opportunity he takes on F5 and now if it's not so easy to recover the pawn and that's what you can see Anan stops a bit King F6 and here's a nice move you can start with King F3 that's fine but after he takes here you should go Bishop D4 this is an important move that nihal has to find or you could have started here with Bishop D4 and after King F5 gone King F3 that would also lead to a similar position but nihal gets a bit greedy and takes the pawn but vishi very very smart he go goes to the other side and attacks the pawn on H5 King E6 and now the pawn is hanging on C4 gives a check defends the pawn and now can push the pawn to C5 King D6 played and yes nihal pushes the pawn so he is actually a pawn up a very very solid Pawn up in the position Rook to E7 the threat is to take the pawn on G7 but now Knight takes on H5 has been played defending the Pawn King to G4 attacking the Knight and Knight comes back check well it still feels that white has the initiative here King F5 he's trying to come into G6 to attack the pawn on G7 but vishy brings his rook in and now it's not so easy to take this Pawn because there's a knight H5 check here and you are in trouble so Rook C7 King comes up and nihal goes in with his King but now Anand plays his Knight this is exactly the kind of defense that one should learn from an experienced player like Anand although he was under pressure he actually defended very defended it very commendably Rook takes F4 and although nihal will be a pawn up here now vishi can actually defend this with check King has to move you can see both players now know that the game is drawn King G7 and Anand plays his Rook to C6 and now once the Rooks are traded the C5 Pawn Falls and there you have it a draw has been agreed between them what a nice game between nihal and Anand uh and actually the little boy was pressing very so slightly in the game he could have had much more than a draw uh because after wishi slipped a bit with F5 but it was was a draw the first ever encounter between nihal serin and Vish Anand and in fact the only encounter until 2023 between these two guys they haven't played again no no yeah no I actually got but um should got that for 10 years yeah uh no actually Bishop D4 check and King F3 is unpleasant I I was uh I I got Gess there Bish yes but I go for this B first so you play Bishop D4 you attack this so I think I will play G5 maybe after knight6 and F push me back King F7 could be and then I try to go the yes probably no like I said I just uh for one minute I I played ffi and then I saw that we before and yeah but I mean I just have to play a there's nothing like or just e g EF and G5 also because now I see if I attack that p as well after or you have a meaningless P so think can can I play f66 f yeah no this was the only serious because the other line I think I have to be a little bit careful but G [Music] this"}, {"instruction":

2839 and playing Amazing Chess at the European Club cup once again sets his eyes on playing classical chess as is always the case he fills up his score sheet adjusts all his pieces which he loves to do before the game this time he's arrived before time so he's not losing out time in doing so and his opponent is a 2438 rated 18-year-old Indian IM SRI har LR there you have him a shake hand and Shri Hari is a strong player he is an upcoming Talent he he plays well but it's also very exciting to see a 2400 rated IM take on a super GM like Magnus because you you kind of never see this kind of pairing happening in tournaments and it's only in first rounds of such open events like the Qatar Masters is this possible one of the most important things that the organizers of this tournament did was to first check with Magnus what are his dates and only then were the dates of this tournament revealed as Magnus was ready to play it in October so Magnus has his fans everywhere as this lady wants a picture with him and Magnus actually smiles before the game this is not very common because generally Magnus wants to be in his Zone but this is the first game of the open tournament and so he is in much relaxed mood there and there we have the dignitaries making their way to the top board we have the oran organizers we also have the FED president aradi dcoic who has come here and generally it's the trend in the tournament that they make the first move and C4 it is there you have Magnus smiling and the game is about to begin 1 C4 has been played and so we are ready to go now uh we have 1 and half hours for 40 moves and 30 minutes after that with 30 seconds increment per move 1 C4 was made by the guests and Magnus sticks with the move presses the clock it's now shar's move and what is he going to play here will he play E5 will he play C5 will he play Knight F6 he decides to play C6 a very solid move asking Magnus if he wants to enter the slow territory with D4 well Magnus has to think now he can play D4 4 he can play Knight F3 he can also play Knight to C3 so there are many options in this position Magnus and trying to be very very calm because generally what opening you choose in your first game makes a huge impact on your entire tournament and here Magnus goes for the move d4 he pushes his Pawn to D4 and now let's see what Shri Hari comes up with I think a very logical move now is to play D5 and he does exactly that we have the slow defense on the board and now Magnus can bring his Knight out to F3 he can also put his Knight to C3 although Knight C3 is lesser played he plays his Knight to F3 the slow defense is considered as one of the most solid openings out there and Knight to F6 by Shri Hari the main moves now are to play Knight to C3 or Pawn up to E3 there are two moves here which are very very popular and both of them lead to deferring positions it has to be seen what Magnus plans to do here and he goes for the move G3 this is not very popular way to play but it's also interesting generally G3 is played a lot against the pawn on E6 and that is known as the Catalan but with Pawn on C6 your Bishop on G2 generally is hitting on this Granite structure here uh and also often black can just take the pawn on C4 and cling onto it with B5 so there are all these possibilities but right now SRI Hari just plays his Bishop to F5 and he brings it outside the pawn chain black could play the move move E6 later on and he doesn't want his Bishop to be passively positioned on C8 well one of the important things that has happened with the move G3 is that Magnus has actually taken his opponent perhaps out of well-known Theory and also Magnus might have analyzed this position in quite some depth for his world championship matches and so on and he plays his Knight to C3 which is very important to note because when you play G3 you want to generally follow up with Bishop G2 on the next move but with Knight C3 what Magnus is saying is that maybe my M Bishop doesn't need to move for the time being perhaps it could be activated from the other side as well we'll see E6 played by shrihari and if he gets the time he would love to play H6 make Square for the bishop on H4 uh on on F5 but Knight H4 is is played attacking the bishop and that is exactly what Magnus has done taking advantage of the fact that the bishop does not have anywhere to go without being captured if Bishop G4 we always have H3 and G4 winning the bishop there so SRI Hari plays D C4 very interesting decision but also a very double-edged one because you are giving the bishop pair to Magnus Carlson and that is not something that can be done very lightly in such positions Magnus takes on F5 doubling black pawns but that's not the most important thing here after Knight F5 EF5 what you will realize is that white has the bishop pair but black has control over the E4 Square he can move his Bishop castle and put his Rook on E8 also get control on the half open file e file so here Magnus goes for the move E3 very interesting move and he's saying that I want to take this Pawn with the bishop if you now try to save it then the bishop would be very strong on this diagonal and the threat is Knight to B5 so that's the reason why shrihari doesn't care for that pawn as much and goes Bishop D6 very logical chess and he says to Magnus take your Pawn but you know what your Pawn on G3 may hurt you later because your light squares would be weak Magnus says but the light squares are weak but you don't have a light squared Bishop so you really can't take advantage of this castling done by black here already the opening looks very very imbalanced and this is just the kind of position that Magnus wanted I believe when facing a player who is 400 ELO points lower than him to get a complex position where there are imbalances and where he can sort of outplay his opponent with his understanding Queen comes out to F3 very very interesting move you you could have just castled there which would have been a normal move but Queen F3 has a point firstly you are attacking this Pawn on F5 and if Shari has to decide how to defend it he can defend it in couple of ways one is Queen D7 other is G6 he goes for the G6 move and now the next move you must play pay very close attention to this move because this shows how Magnus is always switched on he does not play mechanically he's always looking for opportunities what should white play here now if you think about it move H3 comes to your mind what a fantastic move the idea is to play G4 and once fg4 H G4 The Rook opens up on the H file the pawn can move away the Knight the bishop is looking here and the queen so black is actually sitting on a time bomb here Queen E7 is a phenomenal move why is this a fantastic move the reason is if Magnus now goes G4 which looks the most logical then C5 is a brilliant breakthrough and now the threat is to take and if you push D5 then you have Knight D7 and the Knight jumps to the E5 Square so Queen E7 pinning this Pawn this way is a very good idea and that's the reason why Magnus now castles he does not like the fact that G4 was being met with C5 and he castles it out and he also realizes this fact that it's not really only the opening of the H file which could be important it's also that after G4 takes takes the E Pawn can move forward and the bishop opens up H5 played by shrihari this was perhaps not the best idea better was to just complete your development with Knight D7 and black is doing fine but he plays H5 this was his first long think of the game 133 minutes taken to play H5 and now Magnus plays this very nice more Rook e one because his idea is to play E4 and open up the bishop and even if black tries to stop it Magnus can play E4 after takes takes takes takes takes and this is a very nice sacrifice that is happening so that's the reason why srihari plays Knight E4 trying to stop the pawn from moving ahead but it is a big mistake and Magnus shows it with the move G4 he unsettles the Knight on e4 and suddenly it's very tough position because if you keep the position as it is white is taking the pawn on F5 and you can't take on G4 because then the Knight would be hanging so Knight E4 was a very very bad decision by shrihari and now his position looks quite bad he first takes on G4 which is logical and Magnus is going to take it take it back Magnus also for this obvious move takes a couple of seconds before he plays H takes G4 and now uh I think you have to take on C3 because otherwise this tension is not in your favor you need to release it but the Knight on e4 would be hanging so first taking here Knight takes C3 B takes C3 and fg4 makes sense but then there is pressure here and here E4 is coming Bishop is opening up and so Shri Hari plays Bishop B4 trying to take advantage of this pin of course if Magnus had to sort of uh care for that this position was completely fine for black but as can clearly be understood by a player of magnus's caliber he takes on F5 and he tells Shri Hari well go ahead take on F5 take here take on C3 double attack my Rooks I'm fine with it because I've calculated further and what is it that Magnus has calculated we will see but it is important for Shari now to take on C3 because if you don't do it well what was the point of Bishop B4 so he takes on C3 and now Magnus uh has to decide whether he wants to take the Knight or not is taking seems like the most logical thing to do but there are also possibilities like A3 hitting the B Bishop which is a possible move there you can see Magnus being completely focused he takes on C3 and now when Bishop takes on C3 here next move then there will be a double attack on the Rooks that are there on A1 and E1 so let's see what what happens here SRI Hari now takes the pawn on C3 important moment in the game because now Magnus is losing material but you can see that he senses and also has calculated some lines that the bishop is strong there's a threat to take on G6 the queen is well placed and not to forget if the pawn moves up to E4 then the bishop simply opens up meanwhile Black's pieces are all undeveloped and not doing so well but should you play Pawn to F6 should you play your queen to G3 because then you are threatening Queen takes G6 with this pin well Magnus goes Queen to G4 very interesting move and he tells sari that look if you take here I'm going to take this king h8 queen check King here and now a very important move Bishop A3 and the point is if you take here I'm just going F6 and checkmating you on G7 there is no way to stop it so that's the reason why here King G7 was played by shrihari to stop Queen from taking the pawn on G6 and how should Magnus continue now is the question his both the Rooks are still hanging and he must figure a way out and he plays this absolutely stunning move E4 what a move this is with this move he's opening up his Bishop you can see how Magnus is making use of each and every piece in his position while black is not really caring for his development it's already too late now sari can take either of the Rooks here on A1 or E1 but then the bishop jumps out he takes the one on A1 because he he may be intense that at some point he can take back the pawn on D4 and bring his Bishop back into the defense for Magnus it makes complete sense now to play his Bishop to G5 which is what he's going to do Bishop G5 important move and the Tactical point that should be pointed out is that after F6 you have this very nice check and after King takes Queen G6 is Checkmate so that's the reason why F6 cannot be played you have to kind of move your queen away let's say you go here but then comes Queen H4 which is also a very strong attack there so he plays Queen to B4 attacking The Rook now uh you may want to even sacrifice The Rook in some lines you know that should also be winning uh because then you can move your king away but I think the simplest is to play F6 King goes to G8 and now how do you finish this off is the question well one idea a very cute little move is King G2 because after Queen takes E1 there is Bishop E3 and queen G6 is threatened and the queen can also come here and Checkmate so that's a very nice win but Rook A1 is the more human approach the more Magnus approach and keeping all things intact because after Queen takes C4 which is a natural move Queen H4 to H6 to G7 cannot be stopped in any case so Knight comes out to D7 srihari is hoping that he can take the pawn here but it would replace it would be replaced by the bishop there so there's no real way of sort of Clinging On to the material and here um why is going to play Queen H3 very nice move Magnus not really tempted by winning material there he just simply goes Queen H3 threatening Queen H6 to G7 and if you play something like Queen D6 then Queen here Knight F6 Queen takes G6 notice this Spin and F6 is hanging so after Queen H3 shrihari resigns Magnus scores an emphatic win there in the first round of the tournament with in 23 moves this is going to be an epic event as Magnus looks in stunning form here he is also uh joined by Hikaru Nakamura and Hanish giri you see that shrihari taking the opportunity to discuss some chess moves with Magnus and I think Magnus just mentions to him that your pieces were not playing in the game and instead of H5 Knight D7 would have been a better try to develop your pieces that was the first round of the Qatar Masters open this is going to be a very very exciting event to follow"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

we are ready to go vantia with white opens the game with 1 D4 the time control is 90 minutes for 40 moves and 30 minutes increment after move 40 with 30 second increment per move Hikaru plays his Knight out to F6 wantika goes C4 now wia's playing style is very classical she loves to play strong solid openings controlling the center she brings her Knight out and one of the openings that is her absolute favorite is the Catalan which she's going to try to play here against one of the best in the world Hikaru Nakamura G3 played and Hikaru goes to B4 with a check and one of the ideas of this move is to provoke the bishop to come to D2 and then later drop back to E7 that's what Hikaru does he brings his Bishop back claiming that the bishop on D2 is slightly misplaced here wantika puts her Bishop on G2 now and Hikaru just ooh he goes Knight E4 I was wondering if he would Castle here but Knight E4 hasn't been played in too many games but this is an idea of Richard r ort actually to take this bishop wtia is well prepared she plays Queen to C2 and she says to Hikaru that if you want to waste another move and take the bishop you are most welcome to do so it'll help me in my development and later I can break in the center with E4 and with this move she gets up from her chair Hikaru quickly blitzes it out C6 he still has 1 hour 32 minutes on hand and very well prepared wantia now decides to Simply Castle it out brings her King to safety how is Hikaru going to continue next is the question so after short castles Hikaru will most likely Castle as well no he goes Knight to D7 he finishes his development but the but one of the problem for Hikaru is the bishop on C8 it's not at all active and maybe it could come out via this diagonal later on Knight comes out to C3 and wtia is hoping that Hikaru would take here then she could take with the Knight and play E4 but instead Hikaru makes his Knight on e4 into a strong point in his position and also gets this Stonewall structure on the board with F5 very interesting move now how does wantika continue here is a question one very interesting move is to go Bishop F4 but instead she takes on e4 that's a very committal decision she's taken on e4 and now Hikaru can take with the F Pawn as well as D Pawn he decides to take with the F Pawn which is very logical because next move he can shot castle and his Rook already has an open file onea can now bring her Knight back to E1 and later break in the center with F3 but instead she goes Knight to E5 a logic iCal move putting her Knight on the center of the board now Hikaru can take the Knight because this Knight is very strong in the center and could then attack the pawn on E5 so he takes it Knight takes on E5 and wantika takes back with her Pawn D takes E5 now this Pawn could become a strength as well as a weakness you can't immediately win it in any way for example if you try to go Queen C7 and attack this always F4 is possible and after takes you can take back with the rook and this one E4 comes up it's not safe to win this Pawn so for the time being Hikaru simply castles he's not really going after this pawn and vantika now has to decide how is she continuing this she brings her Rook to D1 that's a very good place for The Rook because it's the open file and also notice that there could be some ideas of taking this pawn and unleashing an attack on the black queen for the the time being the position is equal Hikaru Nakamura now starts to think what should he do he plays B6 he solves the important question of this bishop it would either go out on B7 or also on E6 attacking this structure where should white play the bishop here he plays his Bishop to E3 interesting move opening this up and also threatening Bishop E4 so if you play Bishop A6 there is Bishop E4 and white is winning so that's the reason why Hikaru quickly moves his Queen away from this file and vanka's next move is fantastic she plays F3 and she's ready to open up the position for her Bishops there is one weakness in Black's camp and that is the Pawn on E6 not so easy to attack but always good to keep in mind the bishop could pop out here and attack it Bishop A6 played by Hikaru and his point is if you take here on e4 I'll take with the pawn and then you will have tripled pawns on the eile so that's the reason why wantika goes B3 and solidifies her structure here she has played really well until Mo 16 here against Hikaru and has got a very fine position but Hikaru is sure to make more important decisions for vantika to take along the way he's going to keep on posing her with lot of questions he first takes the pawn now important question do you take with the bishop the pawn or The Rook all three look fine but I think taking with the pawn makes a lot of sense because then you can push the pawn to F4 and connect the pawn chain so he does take e takes F3 and next move is F4 coming up and Hikaru now goes Queen G6 he's offering a trade of Queens here because after Queen takes H takes he sees that it's very difficult for wantika to keep these this Pawn structure intact and that's the reason why vantika keeps the Queens on the board very interesting decision she's going for Fighting Chess she's kept her Queen on C1 and asking Hikaru what's he going to do next he goes rook d8 and now a very logical move is to play F4 opening up the bishop and also connecting her Pawn structure here is WKA going to play F4 yes she does she plays her Pawn to F4 the only problem for wtia is that she's down to 15 minutes on the clock while Hikaru has 40 minutes that is a big issue but otherwise her position is very cool H5 played by Hikaru nice move he wants to create play here with H4 and vantia needs to be careful how is she going to meet this attacked by Hikaru Nakamura she goes Bishop H3 nice move look at her just moving that Bishop there and angling on that E6 Pawn which we earlier said was a weakness if Hikaru plays H4 which is the most uh natural move and he plays it white has a very powerful move here Queen B1 because now if Queen takes there is Bishop E6 intermediate check and if the queen moves away I can go G4 so with that white would be clearly better but instead wtia goes King F2 this is not a good move because now the white king starts to get a bit exposed and also putting your king opposite The Rook is never a good idea wtia could have found Queen B1 there which was a very powerful move but she couldn't find it because she was low on time now after d Tak C4 she can take back with bakes C4 but you can sense that Hikaru is slowly taking over in this position his pieces look better placed one takes back the pawn B takes C4 and now C5 seems like a natural idea to play because with this move the bishop can then drop back on this long diagonal that is exactly what Hikaru wants and he plays his Pawn to C5 and with 28 minutes on the clock wantia is down to 8 minutes she has to play 18 more moves against the fastest player on the planet which is not going to be easy how does one think continues she goes Queen B1 and she offers the trade of Queens this time Naru is not going to take it because he's not going to be tempted by winning of a pawn here because Bishop E6 check exists as an intermediate move he goes Queen H6 which is a great move because now if you try to play G4 there is Rook takes F4 the king is misplaced on F2 so that's the reason why G4 is not possible and wantika already very low on time plays Queen E4 she has 4 minutes 30 seconds left and her point is that if you now take on G3 she wants to take back with the king so that her Bishop is no longer hanging there and Hikaru takes on G3 now King takes G3 seems like a decent move and is Hikaru going to play that he's taking his time there wtia plays King G3 and now there's a very powerful move that Hikaru has Rook F7 extremely difficult to find but the idea is to clear this bishop and to bring this bishop down on this long diagonal of course extremely difficult for any human being to find and so he plays Bishop C8 but now oneka is back in the game she can go King G2 bring her King back to G2 she does that she has 2 minutes on the clock and she has to make 14 more moves but her position is fine if she can manage to keep her cool Hikaru goes Queen H5 and he's looking at this E2 square a good idea is to Simply trade off the Queens with Queen F3 will will vantika find it it's not easy she takes on d8 1 minute 30 seconds left for wtia and Hikaru now can take back with the bishop or The Rook both both look fine he decides to take back with the rook and now important is to play Rook F2 or Rook F3 stop the queen from entering the position White's position is playable it's not the prettiest but it's fine but instead oneka goes all out on the attack with just 18 seconds left pushing your Pawn to F5 is never a good idea Hikaru adjust the pawn and he knows that it's not a good move all he has to do is now calculate this to Perfection and he does it he first gives a check now you can't really move your Bishop because your queen would hang so Rook F2 makes sense now as the only move in the position and wantika plays it Rook F2 but now can Hikaru find the next move yeses finds it instantly Queen to D3 what a beautiful move played by Hikaru because now after Queen takes Rook takes the bishop is hanging she takes here and you will realize that if the bishop moves away I simply give a check here and the bishop on H3 Falls so that's a huge problem there for wantika agrawal she goes Pawn up to F6 and yes her own Bishop is hanging but there is f takes E7 and a mate here or queen is being made so not to take that first place Bishop takes F6 what a nice move by Hikaru he calculates this with such Precision if there's one player who manages to convert winning positions with ease it is Hikaru Nakamura he does that beautifully and now there's no time to play fg7 because there's Bishop B B7 check followed by Rook takes H3 and F7 does not help because after King f8 the pawn is going nowhere so that's the reason why vantia moves her Bishop away to G4 and is trying to hope that her position can survive this but Hikaru gives a check here he plays a check and now of course you can't block because everything would be traded and the king and pawn end game is losing so you have to move the king away she goes King G1 and now uh one I idea is to give a check but after a check there is Rook F1 and white is still surviving so Hikaru plays this classy move which is Bishop A6 and his point is that he may want to give a check and then take the pawn on C4 that's what is his idea meanwhile wantika tries to defend the C4 Pawn with her Rook she's facing trouble from all ends because she is time wise only has 30 seconds on the clock and position wise she's two pawns down against Hikaru this is uh almost good to resign now because if she takes on F6 she goes King F2 Hikaru quickly brings her Rook back to E5 and if you take on F6 there is Bishop takes C4 coming in so everything is just falling apart now and uh yeah wantika takes on F6 but Hikaru now chops off the pawn on C4 he's two pawns up and the rest is pretty easy let's go in the fast motion and see how Hikaru manages to convert this with ease and even though the players reach move 40 um Hikaru is doing it very easily here exchanges the Rooks King comes up Pawn to E5 King goes back he brings here pieces get traded Bishop comes back now he's Pawn up and you can see that this is quite easily done by Hikaru using both his pawns to rush down the board and he's bringing the king from the other end and wtia resigns and with this Hikaru wins the game very inter interesting game there vantika played the first 20 moves quite well she was matching blow for blow uh with Hikaru but in the end Hikaru showed his class with Queen D3 and I really like the fact how Hikaru actually finds the time to discuss the position with his opponent throughout the trail better maybe it's it's straight"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

the black pieces to decide how to react it's always exciting when super GMS take on IMS who are rated around 2400 that's a gap of nearly 300 ELO points there and is that going to show in the game is what the question everyone has on their mind D4 by Anish and now what does Rohit play he goes D5 so very solid system and will Anish now play C4 transposing it into Queen's Gambit territory no he actually plays Pawn to C3 inspired by nihal serin perhaps because he likes to play C3 and with this move Anish has played against the move C5 because then you can take and protect that pawn so Bishop F5 has been played by Rohit and now Anish can put his Bishop to F4 but also there is an idea to put Queen on B3 to attack B7 and he does exactly that he puts his Queen on B3 attacks the pawn on B7 how does Rohit defend it clearly you don't want to play a move like B6 and ween the light squares so he goes Queen C8 which is the best move and now often we have seen white players losing a Tempo to play the move C4 is Anish going to do that well he's taken quite a bit of time 5 minutes for this move and played his Bishop to F4 not leaving the piece oh he brings his Bishop back what he's touch that piece what has what has happened to Anish well finally he does play it to F4 and smiles well that is quite an interesting thing that Anish did there maybe he forgot his opening prep and maybe he recollected that oh I had to go C4 there something did go wrong but it's a normal move it's a decent move E6 played by Rohit now and Anish can continue his normal development here with Pawn coming up to E3 now he plays his Pawn to E3 presses the clock and moves on and now Rohit thinks for 5 minutes brings his Bishop to E7 it's a very non-confrontational opening that we have but one which can very quickly get very sharp so first Anish plays his Knight to D2 controlling the E4 Square the Knight is well positioned here and later he can play his other Knight to H4 trying to win the bishop pair that's a very typical idea also played by Magnus in his first round game castles is not a good move by Rohit because now Anish does have the opportunity to play Knight H4 and win this bishop he does play it Knight H4 on the board and now he's going to win the bishop because if you play Bishop G4 trying to preserve it there is H3 Bishop H5 and G4 and eventually I can take the bishop here so Rohit goes C6 and he tells Anish I'm okay with the fact that you will win my Bishop but what I will have is some kind of Harmony the harmony lies in the fact that I will have my pawns on light squares even the one on F5 I will have these pawns and my Bishop will be on dark squares and that is how Rohit sort of enves that his position is pretty fine Anish now develops his Bishop to E2 which is a very interesting decision because he could have also put his Bishop on D3 which is an active square but he he has some deep idea on his mind A5 played by Rohit trying to expand on the queen side and now Anish can simply Castle natural move but he goes H3 very nice move and this is something to learn from whenever your opponent has this Pawn here and your Rook is still on H1 you can play G4 and open up lines he goes Rook E8 and maybe it's time for Anish to push his Pawn to G4 he thinks for a bit because Anish really likes Clarity in chess and that he seems to have found with this move G4 takes on G4 and Rohit is quite confident that he's not giving his opponent too much there H takes G4 played now if you get the move G5 white is clearly better with the Rook on the open file so it's very important for Rohit now to take the pawn on G4 good or bad he must take it along with the support of the queen here he takes it two options here for white one is to come back Queen D1 hit the Knight the other one is to come to C2 or to take on G4 well Anish goes and takes it this might not be the best idea from an attacking perspective but I think Anish is very happy that he's able to recover the pawn which is the Pawn on B7 he takes it yes he's going to take the pawn queen takes B7 so now the material has been equalized and also the Rook is hanging so you need to move your knight away Knight to D7 looks like the best move and that is the move that Rohit has played Knight to D7 but now Anish has the opportunity to take another pawn and notice that Rook cannot come on B8 neither of the Rooks because the bishop controls that square so Anish very greedily chops off another Pawn this is greedy Anish in action he's now a Pawn up the only problem is that his Queen his King is still in the center of the board Queen F5 played by Rohit and now Anish can quietly go back with his Queen to A4 which he does he brings his Queen back to A4 and he's hoping that he can go long Castle Queen C2 and trade the Queens off very interesting move here by Rohit is G6 so that whenever Queen C2 comes he's not forced to exchange the Queens there is a Pawn in between the queen and its attack on that S Pawn Anish long castles good or bad he had to do it now the point here is that there are these two files open against the white king and Rook C8 Rohit takes one of those files now Queen C2 should be played that seems like a very logical move but he goes Rook G1 which is also fine The Rook is placed on the open file and there are some very interesting tricks that can happen Rook A6 is a big mistake and here Anish has a great tactic the tactic is to play Rook H5 now the pawn can't take because it's spinned and queen takes is met with Queen takes D7 and actually Anish does not find it he goes Rook G3 he misses this point and now black is back in the game if Rohit plays Knight F6 he is doing phenomenally well because Rook B6 there's pressure here he goes Rook C6 which is also fine he is threatening at some point to take here so Black's position does look very intimidating so Anish quickly goes and offers a trade of course if you take the Queen White is out of danger zone so black keeps the queen on the board with Queen E6 and now the threats are to play A4 A3 and if you play A4 A3 then Bishop takes A3 comes in so King B1 played by Anish he's trying to run away with his King but A4 fantastic move by Rohit Krishna here taking the pawn here would not be the best idea as The Rook opens up and it could lead to a huge attack so Anish ignores it and plays in the center good move Center play A3 fantastic move by black now the game is heating up because C3 Pawn is getting weak the base of the chain has been hit B3 played by Anish here well one of the things which E4 did do is open up the defense of the Rook on C3 so the pawn is no longer hanging but Rohit brings another piece to attack now Anish takes the pawn on D5 he seems to have calculated it all he looks very calm Queen takes D5 and now a fantastic move Queen E4 with this he's able to trade the Queens because if the queen moves away then this is hanging on B4 maybe Knight F6 oo he attacks the queen and also defends his own so Anish takes the queen and now Knight takes D5 has been played the Knight is attacking C3 and F4 so you need to take the bishop now he does take the bishop or not yes he does he takes the bishop on B4 and now Knight takes on F4 is possible yes he takes Knight takes f4 on the board and now white needs to decide how to continue I think anish's next move very logical puts his Knight on C4 stopping the black Rooks from entering the position is still very complicated because although white is a pawn up for now the Knight on D5 is attacking the pawn Anish must play the move B5 that's the best move in the position but he makes an error he takes here and Rohit must take this Pawn on B4 and black is really doing well but instead Rohit gets tempted with the move Rook F6 which is not a great idea because now Anish can give up this pawn and play B5 that is what he can do but instead he plays F3 and now Rohit must take the pawn on B4 with his Knight it seems like the best option here Knight takes B4 and black is doing well but he goes Rook C3 and this is not a good idea because Rohit does not care about the pawn on B B4 he's trying to win the F3 Pawn how is that pawn even very important B Pawn is the key Pawn because the pawn is moving down the board it's only three steps away from queening well but for Rohit he loves that the fact that he has these three connected passers on the king side that's the reason why he takes and now Rook takes on F3 and the thing is that black would be completely fine in this position if his Pawn started to advance however Rook C1 is a fantastic move that Anish has played his ideas could revolve around Rook C5 kicking this Knight out but H5 played and now Knight comes to to C4 Anish has 6 minutes 55 seconds Rohit has 3 minutes 40 seconds and here it's totally winning Pawn comes to H4 important move because if you played Knight C3 check I can simply take take and push my Pawn to Queen so that's the reason why he pushes his Pawn to H4 and now Anish plays his Pawn to B6 Rohit takes it Knight takes Anish is a piece up and this should be very straightforward victory for Anish giri but the black pawn say wait a bit we are coming down the board and the Knight is slightly out of the game so Anish pushes his Pawn on D5 this is the best move in the position next he can go D6 D7 as well H3 played by Rohit and now important is to play D6 a very important move and the winning line can go D6 Rook D3 D7 F5 King C2 and now this way you are able to control all of the pawns and white is better but instead Rook D1 played this is not the best move because now Rohit plays H2 and D6 still is winning but now it's getting more and more sharp in this position because you have Rook D3 Rook D3 and H1 Queen but Anish goes Rook H1 and this is already a mistake because he's missed his opponent's next move Rohit has seen something that Anish hasn't and that is the move G4 and you can sense that Anish has missed something very big here because after Rook takes H2 which is his plan in comes G3 he takes on H2 but now G3 is very very powerful because after Rook F1 and Rook F2 black is able to trade G3 comes in and you can see Anish has 27 minutes on the clock but his position now very difficult he thinks only for 2 minutes and he plays Rook H4 because that's the only move here you know you go Rook D2 there's already Rook F2 coming in followed by Pawn coming to G2 so that's the reason why Rook H4 now F5 played by Rohit suddenly the position has equalized completely Rook H5 and his idea is to come from behind to stop the pawn is the position now fine for black yes it is he comes King F7 Rohit has defended admirably and this is a great case of never giving up now King C2 you can already push your Pawn to G2 or you can give a Check Yes a check is a good move and now when the king comes up it's very important to play your Pawn to G2 and the defense and the beauty is that after Rook G5 King F6 Rook G8 King F7 King E3 there is the move Rook C2 and The Rook does not get the G3 Square because of Rook C3 check but instead in this position here Rohit has blundered instead of pushing the pawn he gives a check and now King has come to D4 these possibilities no longer exist of taking away each and every Square on the G file from the white rook and this is completely winning position for white now just with this one check Rohit has given up all his chances and now Anish you can see there he's just a bit confused as to where his opponent has missed or what is his opponent's plan to a simple move like Rook G5 well he plays his Rook to G5 and now G2 is hanging so Rook G Rook F2 is played but now you can simply go King E3 and hit the rook and there are many many ways to win now even D6 looks very strong but Anish I think does it in the most clinical fashion he brings his King to E3 and just like that he's now completely winning Rohit takes the pawn on A2 he's still hoping that if he can win the pawn here and this one he should be winning but Knight on C4 takes away these two squares from where the Rook could attack the pawn and it's now very well placed you can see that Anish now knows that he's completely winning this he can just go Rook to G3 back and this time there are no checks on this Rank and he's completely safe yes Rook G3 next move King F3 coming up and you can chop off the pawn on G2 and win the game Rook C Rook C2 played by uh Rohit but there is this move King F3 and I think it's time to resign Anish giri has played this well this end game was just so so complex and at some point from a completely winning position it turned into a draw and then again Rohit blundered and there you see he resigns Anish shakes hands with a smile Rohit played very very well fought very well but Anish in the end you could see you can see from his face that he has dodged a bullet"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess

who has a rating of 2470 and is inching closer towards becoming a GM Magnus lost his second round game against alisher sulov yesterday and this one is a big big game for him cuz he cannot afford another loss he opens the game with one E4 E5 and now brings out his Knight to F3 what is mutaya going to do is he going to play the most popular move in this position Knight to C6 no he goes Knight F6 this is the pet defense and this is not going to be an easy nut to crack for Magnus because this is one of the most solid openings in the world of Chess Knight takes E5 played by Magnus he snatches is the Pawn in the center and of course one of the biggest traps in the Chess World is if you take the pawn there is Queen E2 so at the top level always everyone plays D6 Knight goes back to F3 and now mutaya can safely snatch the pawn on e4 let's see what Magnus goes for the main move here in this position is to push your Pawn to D4 and grab space in the center but Magnus pushes his Pawn just one square and this is an opening that Magnus has championed he played this at the recent speed chess championship against Yan nepom Nishi who is a big expert at the pet and now you push the pawn another Square you don't want the Knight to be on e4 you want it back on F6 so that's the point now the main move here is to gain space back in the center with D5 but mutaya plays G6 this is not played much often but there are games here in fact Magnus Carlson himself has played a game with white pieces against Ivan sharich here it also continued Bishop D3 now one of the problems that Black Faces in this position is slight lack of space that's the only thing otherwise this bishop is actually well positioned you know on this diagonal Bishop G7 played and now Magnus thinking about what his next next move ought to be I think shot Castle makes complete sense yes he castles it out and also black would really want to Castle because Rook e one check is being threatened here to the black king you can see that Magnus is tremendously focused on the board mutaya has 1 hour 23 minutes now he's taken up 7 Minutes in the opening which means he's not particularly super well prepared H3 play played this is played against the bishop here because black having less space would love to get more pieces of the board by moving his Bishop to G4 and Magnus stops it so now mutaya wants to get his Bishop on this diagonal however that diagonal is not going to be easy as Magnus plays C4 and his point is that later when Bishop comes here he wants to block it with pushing his Pawn one square forward well mutaya anyway goes Bishop to B7 he says to Magnus that well you could block me but I can fight back with my own Pawn there so Bishop B7 has been played now Magnus develops his pieces it's quite simple you know the openings at top level you control the center bring out your pieces and that's exactly what Magnus is doing here Rook comes to the open file that's a good move if black is successful in trading pieces he would be doing well here because he's low on space but for the time being it's not so easy Bishop comes out to E3 not particularly a great Square for the bishop but it's now come up the queen can move upwards and the Rooks can get connected muta also finishes his development by playing Knight to D7 how is Magnus going to proceed here it's a question he plays rookie one that's a nice little move because in a way here what is black going to do next is a big question is he going to try he he would love to trade pieces with Knight E4 here like put the Knight here however after takes takes and Bishop G5 it's lost white is completely winning so that's the reason why you can't play that and he plays his Pawn to H6 maybe now he has this idea of playing Knight E4 so Magnus shuts down the position he plays Pawn to D5 and now mutaya is worried a bit about his Bishop you know on B7 what should he do about it however he's got one square for his Knight exactly the Knight jumps to C5 and tells Magnus that you close one thing but you open another and now the bishop goes back but I think it's possible now to start trading off pieces on e4 that could be a possibility to move your knight here get a couple of pieces of the board but black plays his Pawn to C6 and with this move what black is intending to do is blast open the position even at the cost of a weakness on D6 Magnus comes Queen D2 he doesn't even worry about taking this Pawn or anything he's attacking the pawn on H6 a natural move is to play King H7 but first mutaya takes the pawn on D5 which is logical and Magnus would take back he he also takes back in the center and now King H7 makes a lot of sense you know just put your king there defend the pawn everything looks great but no he goes Knight E4 wo that is now concrete play and you're taking on the best player in the world trying to outwit him in calculations let's see how that goes Knight takes night okay you going to take back with the Knight that is for sure mutaya now takes with the Knight attacks the queen so the Knight also has to go Bishop takes and isn't the pawn hanging on the side of the board well Bishop takes E4 and now the Rook will swoop in and take this Pawn uh take this bishop yes he takes now Magnus has to make a decision if he takes this Pawn Bishop takes Queen takes the queen will be slightly offside and he will lose his Central Pawn but Magnus is okay with it he takes on H6 of course first The Rook is hanging so you need to kind of save it so Rook takes E1 first yes Rook takes E1 and now he's planning to take the bishop on H6 is I think that's important yes he takes takes deflecting the queen from the defense of the Central Pawn and now you can just snatch the pawn in the center Bishop takes on D5 that is exactly what mutaya does yes he takes on D5 now important moment in the game the Knight is being attacked and there's a fantastic move that Magnus can play which is Knight H2 with the idea of going here here's a nice variation Knight G4 takes here here and you can PL The Rook here to give this check but Magnus actually does not go Knight H2 he plays his Knight to the center and this is not a great Square for the Knight because now mutaya plays a fantastic move Queen F6 this is a very logical move and all of a sudden Black's pieces are coordinating pretty well now the Rook the queen is well placed the bishop is right in the center so Magnus comes back with his Queen can you get greedy and take this Pawn is the question not really after Pawn to B3 the bishop is trapped and it's going to be taken off so first mutaya brings his Rook again great play by the Indian IM he brings this Rook to the C file how is Magnus going to react well he plays Pawn to A3 interesting decision here by Magnus because now he doesn't have to worry about this Pawn being lost A6 mutaya also doesn't want to worry about the Knight jumping to the B5 square and attacking those pawns and that's why he stops it with his Pawn coming forward and now this next move by Magnus is shows his pure sense of Harmony when it comes to chess rookie 3 I really love this move because with this his idea is to bring his Knight to E2 and eventually to C3 The Rook can come to D3 and pressurize D6 with one move he's actually killing many many birds now King G7 you can go Knight E two and Magnus very likely to do that yes Knight comes back to E2 and what a nice reshuffling that's going on here by Magnus Carlson showing his class the bishop is hanging so mutaya goes Bishop C4 another nice little move because now if you go Knight C3 as planned Black Goes D5 very strong move threatening D4 and if you if you take here I take take and the B2 Pawn is hanging so that's the reason why Magnus now decides to go to G3 which is again a good move white is clearly better because the bishop really is not as Superior as the knight in this position so mutaya goes D5 and now Magnus has a very strong move Rook F3 the point to note here is that after Queen E5 there's this killer Moon Knight F5 takes check oops not the check Rook G Queen G5 check King f8 and check and there is this problem but what Magnus does is he plays B3 now this is not a good move because Magnus is forcing the bishop to move back and The Rook opens up and you can see that in the same variation if we go down the line in this exact same thing check Ki there cannot be rookie 3 because this is a Checkmate and that's the subtle point because of which now now mutaya is doing fine again Bishop D7 so Magnus has actually missed his chance to play this move Rook F3 and now black is back in the game again you can't really be taking these pawns because check here Bishop E6 black gets very active so Knight E2 played back Magnus wants to get his Knight to D4 yes statically it does seem that white is better but black is completely back in the game Bishop E6 played here which is a decent move defending the pawn mutaya what a fighter he is he was worse right out of the opening but this is move number 31 and he's still doing pretty well Knight comes to D4 attacking the bishop well do you want to really move the bishop because Knight takes Pawn takes that seems to be okay for black well not really he doesn't move it and plays his Pawn to A5 of course Magnus must not trade too many pieces this would be slightly better for white but not that much and so Magnus now starts to move around and you know he plays his King to H2 maybe he's hoping that at some point he can start to push his pawns on the king side check comes in by mutaya he says to Magnus well do you want to go back with your king or if you're going to push the pawn here your king will get a bit weakened but I think Magnus has to do it he plays his Pawn to G3 and now muta's Point here is that he just goes back with his Queen yes he goes Queen F6 how is white going to make progress and this these are the moments why we love watching magnus's games because we learn how he manages to outwit his opponents King G2 but mutaya is not going to back down so easily King has come to G2 and now what do you do here as black I like this move Bishop D7 well the bishop looks a bit passive that's true but it also controls all the squares that the Knight can move to forward well Magnus goes G4 and with this move Magnus does weaken the dark squares in the position but it could be useful in the future Rook E8 he offers a trade off Rook again a fine move by mutaya Magnus has a choice between moving his Rook sideways or exchanging he takes Bishop takes and now we come to an end game where capablanca used to say that white can claim a small Edge because a queen and Knight function better than a queen and Bishop that's what Jose roll Capa Blanca the third world champion used to think and his logic was that the queen can move diagonally and straight and the Knight can move in L shapes while the queen and bishop move in similar ways but this theorem of course which was accepted wild widely before with the engines maybe not so clear now just Queen D6 Queen Queen E6 all are fine moves but he goes Bishop C6 and this is not a good move of course he doesn't want he he's prepared this that now this Knight is lost but what Magnus does here he goes G5 and tells mutaya what's your plan my friend because now your queen is attacked you need to move it Queen D6 played and now the queen is not attacking the Knight and we've reached move number 40 so Magnus just goes and grabs a bite comes back and now starts to think and he chops off the pawn on B6 after 6 minutes of thought and this was a very critical moment because now mutaya needs to prove his compensation why did he give the pawn well he gave it because he wants to open up this bishop here if Queen takes D4 you simply lose the queen because the Knight is pinned but what a nice move by Magnus King F1 and look at this beauty and subtlety you can't take here and the next move if let's say you push here I go take take and my king is very very close to the pawn and I win so that's why King F1 was important he goes King G8 Magnus now snatches the pawn very important for mutaya to go back Queen E7 because Knight E5 is met with takes here you give a check and pick up the Knight but no he goes Queen E6 he plays this and this is a mistake WIll Magnus spot it the reason why this is a mistake is because kn5 is an unbelievable strong central move Magnus goes 95 fantastic chest there he finds it it's very tough to face Magnus in such technical end games he is able to calculate he's able to find the best moves mutaya says thank you for the Free Pawn there but Magnus now simply moves his King into the center now the bishop is hanging and you will see that the queen and Knight coordinate so beautifully to launch an attack against the king first comes a check which means that the bishop is now protected black is still a pawn down but he seems to be having counterplay here so the King has to move up King D2 played by Magnus Carlson now there are no more checks on the board and black goes Bishop to F3 M interesting because if you take here then I mean black can hold this end game perhaps this this is fine also the threat now is to give checks from here and hassle the white king but Magnus goes Knight D7 what a classy move by Magnus he's just Fearless he sees there's a check I can move up there's another check I can move up there are no more checks and also after a check if you trade Queens that's just a lost end game because the Knight is way superior to the bishop and you're a pawn up so he gives a check but now King E3 and you will see that there's nothing much to do because now Knight is coming in with a check here and it's launching a decisive attack against the king well muta says thank you I can get a free Pawn here that's that's a good news for him but that's all King F4 and now the queen cannot give any more checks the bishop is also very Loosely positioned Knight F6 is coming up so he goes Bishop C6 makes sense here but guys now capablanca would be very very happy because this this is what he was always talking about the Knight and queen coordinate beautifully to launch an attack if King here there's already a check King G uh King G7 is met with Queen G8 mate so he goes King G7 but now it's time for a double check there Knight to H5 or Knight to E8 I think both moves look pretty interesting Magnus plays Knight H5 of course he's seen the end of of this game now if King H7 there is Queen G7 mate the queen is coming in even if King G8 there is Queen G7 so the only move is to run away with your king and mutaya is hoping that somehow he can survive this attack he goes King f8 and now if you give a check the king escapes if you give a check from here the bishop blocks but there is one move that finishes it off very smoothly and you can see Magnus just Mak King sure even a player of his caliber needs to be sure check here if King E8 there's Knight F6 mate so you have to go perhaps King G8 but then after Queen d8 it is over he goes King G8 but now Magnus final move there and it is all over he goes Queen d8 check if King H7 there is Knight F6 check and it is Checkmate time a beautiful game here great great defense by mut but finally he has to yield to the world number one Magnus Carlson wins and he played really well and you can see uh he's analyzing there let's listen to what they saying here for okay"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess

Kh1 Qf3+ 0-1", "output": "welcome everyone it's student versus teacher at the Qatar Masters 2023 gkes is a student at the West Bridge Anan chess Academy and sandipan Chanda is a teacher there let's see how this goes Chanda opens the game with 1 D4 and one thing is clear that sandipan does not teach openings at the Academy so clearly they're going to have a original game both are very creative players and sandipan brings his Knight out to F3 and he's also known for playing some offbeat openings so it will be very interesting to see what he does gkes also brings out his Knight and are we going to see the Queen's Gambit declined with C4 or are we going to witness the London system ooh we have the London on the board Bishop F4 played by sandipan although sandipan's rating right now is 2496 His Highest ELO was about 2650 so very strong player gukesh hits the center with the move C5 and sandipan plays his Pawn to E3 the calmness with which sandipan is making his moves is very cool uh and GES as well a very calm player Knight C6 it's going to be interesting to see who is able to outwit the other H3 plate so we have a pure sort of London system on the board later on we might might see white pushing his Pawn to C3 getting his Knight out to D2 but gkes now plays his Pawn to C6 you know the general move here could be Queen B6 or E6 but the moment he goes G6 sandipan sort of changes his mind and goes Knight to C3 so no longer pure London now because Knight on C3 is not very commonly moved there Bishop comes out and now Chanda takes on C5 okay for gkes now he can Castle it out as black but he goes Queen A5 and he wants to not just take this Pawn but if you're careless and play a move like Bishop E2 to Castle then Knight E4 unleashes a very powerful attack on this diagonal and that's the reason why sandipan blocks this diagonal by bringing his Knight to D2 so he blocks it and now gkes can actually take this Pawn although you have to be careful about a move like Bishop C7 trying to take away the Escape squares for the queen and that's the reason why gkes actually hits the bishop with Knight H5 and he tells sandipan that your Bishop is hanging uh he saves it with Bishop H2 but I think what he wants now is Bishop C3 ooh that was gk's idea so he takes on C3 B takes C3 and now a simple move could be just to take the pawn on C5 but gkes wants more so he takes the pawn on C3 and then he may want to take the pawn on C5 as well when he would be Pawn up so sandipan goes Bishop E2 and if you take Queen takes C5 then I could play Bishop H5 and try to win this Pawn so gukesh quickly goes back with his Knight and now he's intending to win this Pawn here and sandipan says go ahead my friend take it because if you now take it then C4 opens up the position and an open position with a king in the center and white having two Bishops could be dangerous so that's the reason why gukesh also castles and he's saying to his opponent that I don't want your Pawn I have a better structure and I'm happy with it so sandipan now saves his pawn and he is right now equal material but gkes develops the bishop looks at the C2 Square let's take stock of what's Happening Here white has the bishop pair black has better structure Knight D4 is a nice move and a good decision now would be to go back with the bishop or take here and then try to take this Pawn but gukesh takes the pawn on C5 and that is a positionally suspect move because now sandipan after good thought takes on F5 G takes F5 and you can look at the time sandipan has 43 minutes gkes has 38 and white has the bishop pair here Black's King looks slightly weak and Rook B1 fantastic move threats are Rook takes B7 also The Rook can swing over via B5 and put pressure in the center so gukesh does not even care about that extra Pawn that he has won he says to sandipan you can take the pawn now very important you would like to challenge this Rook that has reached the seventh rank but the bishop controls that square so you cannot do it white is getting seriously better here Rook d8 played and let's see how sandipan continues this position he goes Bishop D3 nice move we've always seen that in this structures G4 can be an idea on the cards to sort of open up the king side but Queen f8 played by gukesh he brings his Queen back and maybe the queen is well positioned on the G7 Square Queen A1 played while the position is very complicated and very strategically Rich it is clear that white is the one who's pressing here gukesh moves his night and this is the moment where sandipan could have gotten a decisive Edge by taking whichever way you capture next move you go F3 opening up The Rook one Rook here Queen here it would be a devastating attack but instead he goes Rook C7 which is actually not a good idea because the Rook was doing a brilliant job on B7 by going here he is actually allowing what uh black to trade one of the reasons why sandipan preferred this move is because he was afraid that gkes would move the night back and launch a double attack but now after the trade of Rooks gk's position has become slightly more normal you know he can hold on to it but it's still quite difficult Bishop A6 played nice move there and with Bishop A6 he's attacking The Rook The Rook moves to d8 and mainly these Knights do not have good squares on the board because Bishops are crisscrossing across the diagonals F3 played nice move the Knight has been kicked off from here from the Central Square and it has to move away gukesh goes Knight to C5 and attacks the bishop there on A6 once again it has to move away and he plays Bishop B5 the Knight is attacked where does the Knight go now well one thing is that you can reroute the Knight to the G6 Square so he goes Knight E7 but the moment the Knight moves this Bishop's eyes light up because now the E5 square is weak the Knight was controlling it and the bishop can come on this all important diagonal which he does sandipan brings the bishop right in the center heart of Black's Camp gukesh has to tread carefully now he goes Knight G6 attacks the bishop but the bishop can sit beautifully on the F6 square and later white can start pushing his hedge Pawn he does go Bishop F6 the position of course has become much more stable for black than before but white still still pressing here Rook B8 played and sandipan brings his Bishop back to D3 now we all know that gukesh really loves to play for a win but how much does he think that he can play for a win in such a position because also sometimes you know you also have to be very objective when you're playing against a strong opponent F4 played because there could have been ideas to trap the bishop with E5 so F4 stops it right in it stacks and now Rook C8 played the rook's position is improved and you can see that gkes doesn't want to trade the Knight for the bishop he wants to keep as much you know complex the position can be on the board H4 played by sandep and he's actually pressing very well here Knight goes back to D7 and he's attacking here but we can push our pawn and where will this Knight go actually there are not enough squares he goes H5 and the Knight has to move away but where well first he takes but guys is this going to be a Checkmate or what because imagine this after Queen takes F6 which sandipan has played if you now play your knight back to f8 then H6 is mate oh gesh had this in mind he goes Queen E7 and he pushes the queen away you can't take the Knight because your queen is hanging so if you take the queen then Knight takes and black is completely fine so sandipan comes back which is the best move in the position Knight comes to f8 and now you must push the pawn to H6 to create this he must go F6 and then Rook B1 trying to enter from the other side this is very important that sandipan really keeps his Advantage by pushing the pawn here threatening the mate but he goes Rook B1 one move too soon and that is a major error because because it drops all the advantage that white had in this position because now gukesh can stop that pawn in its tracks with H6 and suddenly the black king is completely safe so a big mistake there but will gukesh find it yes he does he plays at six and now Black's position is fine the king now has breathing space here also this Pawn could have been such a nice attacker Queen B4 offering a trade of Queen so now San hopes that he can actually try and grind this out in the end game where he can hold it against gukesh because right now his position has started to get worse but gukesh goes Queen C7 he keeps the Queens on the board it is Moon number 34 sandipan has 3 minutes gukesh has 8 minutes he goes Queen B7 again asking if the Queens can be traded well you can trade the Queens but gkes is insisting he goes Queen C 5 and he wants to take this Pawn which would be a nice juicy one sandipan can actually save it with King F2 but he goes King H2 right now you cannot take it because your Rook is hanging so gukesh saves it rook d8 and also prepares to get his Knight into the game and E3 Pawn is also loose but sandipan comes back and he's laid a small trap if you take here then Rook F1 is what he wants to do and a check but gkes can play for a win here with Queen B6 Rook G3 come here check King E7 give up the pawn and the engines think black is winning here but gkes is quite you know careful not to take this Pawn he goes Queen E7 back and that is understandable with such less time on the clock he was threatening to give a check the white king comes up and now gukesh can bring his Knight to D7 and bring it into the game this way with this he can attack this he does it Knight D7 slowly and steadily gukesh turning on the pressure also moving towards the 40th move Mark a queen trade is offered once more but this time it's not going to be the queen which is moving away he brings his Knight into the center with 1 minute left for guish and 39th move I think the reaching the 40th move and getting 30 minutes not going to be an issue here for both players Rook G1 played and look at how sandipan is creating an attack he wants to go G4 and attack the black king he makes his 40th move goes away gukesh with 10 seconds plays King f8 moves his King away also protects his Queen and maybe can have some tactical ideas now Queen B2 played threatening a nasty mate and one here 30 minutes for gukesh to work this out of course he's going to see that there is a mate and a beautiful move in the center D4 played here by gkes with Just 2 minutes of thought his point is that if you take which sandipan has done so now a very nice move he can take the bishop but we all know that gkes has no idea or no intention of exchanging pieces in this game he just wants to continue he goes Queen F6 very nice move you can't take the Knight because the queen is hanging and next move you want to take on D4 that's the plan here Queen A3 played sandipan already down to 13 minutes on the clock the position still very rich very tense Queen takes D4 whose King is weaker clearly it feels like white at this point our battery died and so I'm just making the moves Rook F1 Rook D7 Rook F3 King G7 Queen C1 and Rook B7 Queen E1 King went back and this is where we join again the phone was replaced and the new batteries were placed on the phone so there we have the game the camerai is back and now gukesh plays his Rook back to B7 nice move he gets his Rook here although in this position Queen G1 was quite possible there to be played but Rook B7 Bishop goes to A6 kind of forcing gukesh to go Rook B1 again when they would repeat the position but gukesh goes Rook to E7 he brings his Rook there and now I think sandipan is back in the game he goes Bishop F1 this is still very very complicated both sides have Five Pawns each so it's been a long game and I think at some point the tiredness is bound to set in gukesh is just 17 years old and much much more uh strong physically than his opponent in ter terms of energy levels Rook D3 played and he brings his Queen back to F6 what does sandipan do now I think a good idea first he gives a check the King has to go to G7 and very important that the Knight is controlling this Square so that the Rook cannot go here and give a check so King comes up and now the threat could be to enter here with the queen and give a check so sandipan plays his Pawn to G3 yes The Rook can no longer move here but also the queen has been stopped and maybe the bishop can come out this side Knight F2 played by gkes hitting the rook and also threatening a check here he goes Rook B3 the best move in the position and just like that white has created a threat of Rook B8 threatening a mate here gkes is actually on the edge now he must tread very care carefully he goes Check important and now K King G2 is is an important move but sandipan plays King G1 this is not a good move but gkes has to find this amazing move Queen A1 he has just 3 minutes left oh he finds it and his point is if you take here I have a check and this is game over because if you go here there is here and if you go King H1 Queen F2 is a forced mate what a brilliant find by gukesh so he goes C4 and now gukesh plays E5 which is not the best the best move was either Queen E1 or queen E2 but what he wanted was that white should not be able to check his King so he plays his Pawn to E5 and if you take here he now wants to take on A2 but this Rook D3 played by sandipan maybe not the best move here and gkes can go Queen E1 that seems like a very strong move he takes on A2 which is also a fine move by by the way instead of Rook D3 Queen coming back was the best move but now it's all gone Rook D2 played gukesh finds Queen A3 attacking this Pawn on G3 also defending his rook and suddenly with just 25 seconds left sandipan makes the mo King H1 but you can see that his position is just falling apart Queen F3 check is coming in and that is a killer blow because Queen F3 if you move the king then you lose the pawn and if you play Bishop here then after Queen G3 anyway there's a mate so fantastic here Queen F3 played and there you can see that bg2 is losing and sandipan oh they are taking the new score sheets so both the players write their names on the new score sheets because 60 moves have been played and if you play King G1 you lose this Pawn with a check if you play Bishop G2 then Queen G3 threatens a mate and sandipan resigns slightly getting up from his chair with great respect there very nice there game by both the players in fact sandipan was winning and that's what sandipan instantly says I should have pushed my Pawn to H6 I should not have Let It Go"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the

pieces he's so well prepared and so is Aditya it's going to be a battle of preparation who has come better prepared on the board it's Sicilian whoa that's going to be sizzling now let's go E4 C5 what is Anish playing he thinks a bit and goes Knight to F3 generally he keeps a very good track of the young Indian talents and he would know adiya mital very well and his strengths and weaknesses so that's the reason why look at Anish how he's thinking he's like okay if ADI is gone E6 and if I play this maybe he would go for this so might as well try for something totally different which would throw off my opponent of balance and where I can use my experience over the young Talent who's just 2006 born I think these are the thoughts that are going on in anisha's head as he tries to figure out what his third move is going to be very interesting and I mean there are clearly a few options here you can go D4 you can also play G3 a little move there there's also a move like C3 possible but I think these are the only moves right there are there are no too many possibilities and uh both play is not really looking at the board Anish definitely trying to think of all the repercussions is he really thinking about the next move he wants to play or maybe something else I I believe he's thinking about what the move should be and it's almost been 1 and half minutes he has to make a decision there and this is the thing about these top G G Ms they actually try to figure out which line they are they feel are they well prepared in which line would be the most uncomfortable for their opponent which line would you know cause troubles to to their opponent and all of these thoughts have to be taken into consideration before you make this move and this is not to be done lightly because it kind of gives the flow to the game this is a great psychology that we are able to learn at this point and I think Anish has just sort of come to a decision what to play or not Aditya also waiting for the move and Anish now yes he's made a decision you can see he's now in that pose where he's about to make his move come on Anish Let's Make a Move let's go 127 from 131 he's com and he plays C3 wo and look at Aditya is instantly plays D5 showing Anish that all your thought was not very useful because I am prepared for C3 this is psychology oh Anish play E5 because he wants to play D4 and advanced French and adity says no French D4 D3 Knight C6 look at the speed at which ADI is making his moves you know these young Indian talents they are not intimidated by world class GMS they just keep making their moves quickly and want to show the opponent that they are well prepared of course Anish is well worsed with all these tactics he's been playing at the top level for well over over 10 years now so for him this is not really new thing but it feels like ADI is so well prepared even in this sideline however this line has become recently quite popular and you can see that what Aditya wants to do is put pressure on this E5 pawn and that's exactly what he's doing he's attacking here with both his Knights and so for Anish it's not so easy to defend this Pawn because if you play Bishop F4 the Knight will take it and that would be a very good exchange for black so you want to defend E5 and that's the reason why he plays his Queen to E2 and adiya instantly attacks it one more time now to defend it looks very difficult of course Anish is still in his preparation here and I think the move that he's going to come up with is going to be very interesting he goes Knight A3 and Bishop D7 instantly now let me just show you the point if you take here I take here take here then I have Bishop F4 but if you take with the queen here's the classy move Bishop F Bishop E4 with the idea of f4 that is a very interesting concept to know anyway adiya knows all these tricks he goes Bishop D7 Anish plays Knight B5 Queen B8 look at aditya's clock time 1 hour 35 minutes and Anish maybe regretting his decision of going into this line perhaps because you know the main idea of playing C3 was to sort of um surprise your opponent but instead of getting surprised Aditya is blitzing out his Mose by the way this same line was played at the European Club cup recently in October so clearly Aditya has also seen that A6 played now the Knight is attacked act and Anish down to 1 hour 8 minutes as Aditya gets up from the board he has 1 hour 35 minutes and 41 seconds he goes Knight A3 and I think the only time that adiya might lose is actually coming back and sitting on the board to make his next move and he instantly takes it now his plan is to take this Knight on A3 and we already know that taking this Pawn is not going to be easy because Anish brings here his Knight and Bishop check well this is the first new move because in that game B5 was played and after ncd2 white was better so check Anish goes bd2 adiya still in his prep Bishop takes D2 and Anish down to an hour almost and Rook A7 whoa what sort of prep is that he actually plays against Knight B6 move to attack here and he's ready for this check because if this check King E7 and later this this Pawn is lose and this is is hanging and what adiya doesn't want to do is basically play the move B5 here so that's the reason why Rook A7 is played Anish now thinks for nearly 10 minutes plays A4 and gets up from the board because he's confident that he's now brought adiya out of his prep so from 1 hour 37 minutes adiya now down to 1 hour 26 minutes his first long think of the game plays his Pawn to B5 and Anish now chops off the pawn first and you can see that the advantage of having the king of on D2 is that your Rooks are connected but the disadvantage is that this King can become really weak AB played and now the Knight jumps in to D6 fantastic this is a check now Aditya has to bring his King up the board King E7 played and now some threats here right Knight takes E5 Knight takes E5 and then D6 could hang but Anish doesn't care he goes H4 and it's not so good idea to take this because tactically doesn't work so he goes Queen A8 and that is a wise move this is perhaps the best so Anish takes Rook takes on A7 Queen takes on A7 and now if you play H5 then there is Queen A5 check which is a little bit problematic so that's why he goes Rook C1 now if Queen A5 check the king is nicely tucked in with the Rook on the other side so that's the point now the only move for Aditya to equalize in the game is F6 very well played by Aditya because now with F6 the Knight is a bit shaky also if you play H5 E5 is hanging so takes on F6 and you cannot really take here because this Rook G8 and there are many many moves like Knight G5 and the king is actually very weak so that's the reason why he takes back G takes F6 and now what is Anish going to play here what is Anish going to do here he can actually draw the game with Knight F5 King F7 Knight D6 and repeat the moves but he goes for an ambitious approach he goes Knight E4 Rook C8 and I think this is what Anish has missed here that if he goes King E1 trying to run away then Knight B4 is a fantastic move with Rook C8 there's a check Queen D1 there is Knight D3 and black becomes better here so that's the reason why he cannot run away and he has to play H5 move but now both the players sort of getting up from the board sitting down Knight E5 played the time has almost become equal Anish has 34 moves and you can see Anish was a little bit surprised with this move he was thinking Knight f8 is the best move but he goes here Knight takes Knight and now Knight takes on E5 maybe but then could be possible but Adia first gives a check inter medzo he plays this check and does not let the king run run away so Anish plays King D1 and I think you have to play another check because if you take on E5 then after take take and queen C2 white is clearly pushing here so that's the reason why he first gives another check very important move he can actually play King D2 and maybe draw the game but Anish goes Queen C2 he's not so happy with this position you can see and Aditya with this coule of Queen checks has made his position quite solid now if the Queens are traded he shouldn't have too many problems okay he thinks a bit here and now what is the move he's coming up with he takes on E5 and queen takes on A4 it's a good move and now Rook takes on C1 amazing King takes and B takes A4 so let's take stock of the situation after taking here who's better because D3 is slightly weak Anish goes Knight C5 and his idea is to attack this Pawn but you can literally sense it that aditya's position is for choice because Bishop B5 he would attack this twice and he does it he plays Bishop B5 and Anish has a tough choice now what to play he goes King D2 defending here now adya would love to play King D6 but then there is Knight E4 check or Knight D7 check so maybe uh to stop Knight E4 he first goes F5 and maybe now he's is threatening King D6 in the position position so good idea to kick this Knight away and that is what Anish does he plays F4 he kicks the Knight away and this Knight has to go Knight G4 might be a little bit offside so you could go Knight D7 and now if you take here King takes this might be a draw but white has to be accurate somehow it's not so simple so that's the reason why Anish keeps the Knight goes Knight B7 and says to Aditya that your king cannot move up out from here but at the same time his Knight is a bit trapped isn't it Knight on B7 H6 played pawn moves forward and now here white plays Bishop F3 Anish just improves his Bishop Aditya can still press here for sure he pushes his Pawn to E5 excellent move with the pawn push and now Fe takes the pawn Knight takes on E5 attacking once again the bishop and the Knight and Bishop and the pawn and Anish goes back to D1 so that if now Knight takes D3 that is Bishop E2 pinning and if you play Bishop takes D3 then I can take on A4 so he goes back Knight D7 and now Anish what is his plan here he goes Bishop F3 if Aditya wants to continue playing for a win he can try and maneuver his Knight this way but he actually goes Knight E5 and they agree to a draw Anish with a smile on the face and also Aditya well it seems like there was pressure on Anish throughout the game a great match by Aditya great play by him"},

the white pieces opens the game with 1 E4 his opponent is Mt yil maeri from Turkey born in 1992 he's around 30 years old he has come with a calm intention he plays E5 and now gkes plays his Knight out to F3 so if you want to play a calm game of chess what is the opening that you would choose here most often it has to be the symmetrical Petro because it leads to a symmetrical structure and of course a player like gkes who thrives on creating complications cannot do so much in such a position well first of all gkes takes the pawn the Knight is kicked back with Pawn to D6 and now the most normal move is to play your knight to F3 however gkes plays his Knight to D3 and it does sound an anti-intuitive it does look anti-intuitive because it Blocks Your Pawn here and Mt simply takes the pawn on e4 however this is gk's idea he plays his Knight to F4 and this has been played before what he wants now is to put the pawn on D4 here black plays Pawn to D5 and to say that his Knight is much better placed on F4 than on F3 so he plays Pawn to D4 but if you notice carefully you will see that the pawn structure is symmetrical Bishop E7 played by black and already Mort is is thinking he's down to 1 hour 16 minutes it's kind of a new position for him gukesh now places his Bishop to D3 this is all preparation for gkes he has come well prepared for this game and black decides to shot Castle very logical chess very normal chess what does gukesh do next well he also castles it out here and you can see Aditya ml com in to check out the game of gkes what is this new idea that he's come up with now the Knight goes back to F6 so black voluntarily goes back and gkes plays his Pawn to H3 most likely in order to stop the Bishop from coming to G4 The Rook settles down on a open file rookie 8 so one could say that this is a very calm position I don't even know how gkes is going to create some play here you know rookie one it's just going to be a very positional struggle Bishop goes to D6 and so now we have to trade the Rooks it seems very normal to do that yes Rook takes rook and the queen takes back back okay there is some pressure on the D5 Pawn but the Knight is firmly defending it Lukes puts another Knight to attack this Pawn so now there are two attackers the most logical move to defend it is C6 and I believe gukesh is going to play it he does it uh Mt is going to do it he plays it now think about this bishop on C8 it does not really have a great Square to develop and I think that is where gk's small Edge lies right now he goes Bishop to D2 and yma early plays Knight to D7 the Knight develops and now gkes thinking hard plays his Queen up to F3 so you can see that slowly he's building up some pressure against the king he's brought all his pieces and wants to bring the Rook to E1 black now very very calmly plays his Knight to D f8 Knight D7 to f8 and it's a great defender of the king side Rook comes here and attacks the queen so while White's position does look very active after this next move Queen d8 you have to wonder what is it that gkes is going to do here like one idea could be to play Knight H5 and trade but after take take and Bishop comes here nothing much is happening so there you have it gukesh plays Knight E2 and his point is to bring another piece into the attack yilma early plays Bishop D7 normal move calm move okay my thinking is Knight G3 is playable here but gkes goes B3 now this is a two idea move firstly Queen B6 does not attack the pawn secondly you want to play the pawn to C4 and gkes you can see gets up from his chair he is down to 46 minutes so he has spent quite some time trying to figure out what to do here Queen B6 and now the idea of black is that if white plays C4 he wants to trade these Bishops so look at what gukesh does now this is the moment from where gukesh starts to weave his magic he first plays Rook B1 and the point is when C4 is played you can't take because the Rook opens up and if you can't take then C5 will come so he brings his Rook to it for now yilma early is playing normal good solid chess okay C4 is on the board gkes on the other hand is now making the water boil you know he's he wants to create a fire completely uh create some complications on the board but first he he does this now of course he's not going to trade the Bishops he puts the bishop on E3 some threats here to notice one is to maybe take take and win a pawn it's possible so yma nearly defends the pawn and also attacks the one on A2 what does gkes do ooh A3 and this engines do not like because they say Hey you can just take but I think gish's idea is to Simply divert the queen that is what he wants to do and ymas here goes back Bishop D6 he's is not too happy with it and Gish plays Pawn to B4 now the safest Choice here is to go back Queen d8 and even if the pawn is falling you can just let it go and play this position but instead he takes the pawn on A3 and now gk's strategy has worked out he pushes his Pawn to C5 with 18 minutes on the clock and if Bishop takes F4 Bishop takes F4 Bishop F5 takes Queen takes Pawn takes and Rook takes white is still having good play with Bishop C8 so he goes Bishop C7 and now gkes almost traps the queen because if you play Queen A4 there's Knight C3 and the queen is trapped so he goes Queen A2 and this again is going to trap the queen Knight comes out to C3 the queen does not have any squares look at how gukesh from a position that was so simple has created such a messy position but yil maeri is no one to just sit and do nothing he in fact goes in with the Rook King H2 and now is going to sacrifice his Queen that's forced he takes on B1 so now he has a rook and gkes must take back yes he takes with the Knight so he and yilma now takes the bishop so you got a rook and a bishop and a pawn for the queen and there's also this spin so gkes breaks it with Pawn to G3 nine points for nine points Rook comes to E1 The Rook is well placed and now how does gukesh continue he brings his Knight to E2 and tells this Rook sorry my friend you are trapped now I'm going Queen E3 Queen D2 and going to trap you here okay the Knight jumps into E6 and these pieces are all sitting and saying to themselves look we need to save our Rook somehow what do we do well Queen is coming in with this the death bell in her hand H6 and now by the way if you play Queen D2 then there is Knight G5 the Knight jumps in with a check so gkes goes F4 he stops it but with this move G5 fantastic chess blow for blow now the now the bishop is opening up the Knight is looking here the queen comes in to attack the rook and guys this position is getting so intense he takes on E2 because the Rook was anywh trapped I mean if you would have played your Rook to uh F1 King G2 would have trapped it so he takes Bishop takes and now takes the pawn on F4 kukesh cannot take it because if he takes it the bishop moves and gives a check and wins the queen so he plays Knight out to C3 3 minutes for gkes 8 minutes for yilma yearly King H1 played and the position is so complicated because black has two minor pieces and three pawns for a queen which is nine points equivalent and queen is worth nine points so a wonderful material balance on the board but one thing to remember is that in such complex positions gukesh thrives and this can be seen here now Knight comes to G5 and gukesh plays his Bishop to F1 very accurate move you cannot really try and exchange pieces and win them because the queen is a monster if it enters if she enters the position is losing so that's the reason why Knight E4 played gkes takes it now very important was to take with the Knight and the position is still very complex anything can happen but inad he takes with the pawn and gkes quickly plays Queen E2 and you will see that the Queen is all the time looking for options to enter the position Bishop E6 played now if you play H4 move the Knight away and take this Pawn your queen will get pinned so you can't do that he first goes Bishop G2 and he is threatening H4 and taking this Pawn F5 stopping but although this move looks very very nice it doesn't work out and it's the 40th move so you can see that the mistake happens there H4 now the Knight has to move and you can see gkes took couple of minutes and gets up from the chair and goes away Knight comes back to F7 now you you might think oh Queen H5 is the winning moon no but King G7 and queen has no entry there so what is the winning move here for white gukesh finds it easily he plays Bishop H3 attacks the pawn and tells Yas early that I'm going Queen F1 attacking here and your Pawn there's just no way to save it you can see black is not happy he plays Pawn to E3 and gkes had spotted this very little move way in advance so now the idea is maybe to launch some kind of an attack here so gkes calmly brings his King to G1 another fantastic move played by him he's playing so well King G7 played and now can we go Queen F1 it already looks good but we can also go Queen F3 right you can attack the queen and the pawn queen F3 and the way in which Gish is making his moves quickly confidently it just shows how confident he is in such positions such complicated positions Pawn to E2 well gkes now takes the pawn but you had to do it because if you mov the bishop you would have lost this Pawn so Queen takes King comes up and black is hoping that somehow he can keep his position but G says sorry this is not happening in any way he brings his Bishop back and is now angling for the B5 or D5 break A6 stops the B5 break at least for the time being and now how does gkes make progress Queen D3 just threatening the simple move Pawn to D5 he goes H5 and now we could go D5 it's not at all bad move but there's no need to hurry a new weakness has been created and gkes angles on it with Bishop F3 he takes the bishop and attacks it Knight at6 with just two seconds left black plays this move but now gukesh can actually pick up this pawn it looks like a juicy Pawn he takes it he takes the pawn on H5 and what does yerly do he goes Knight to G4 but now gukesh can take the Knight which he does and double the pawn so the Pawn's entire flexibility is lost and they can no longer keep moving and now the queen is way Superior than the two Bishops there's no question about it look at that move Queen E4 attacks the bishop so nicely done there and the bishop has to move and so it goes back to C7 okay just just avoid King G2 because that you will lose the queen uh you can do many things yes H5 pushing the H Pawn is the best thing you can do here also threatening Queen G6 H6 H7 h8 Queen plays Bishop to F5 mhm and now the queen comes to E3 nice little move threatening a check and yil Ma early plays Bishop E6 well Queen H6 is just game over because now with King E7 you can give another check here and then the bishop would be hanging or the H Pawn is queening and I think it's time to call it a day gukesh looks at his opponent and he's like okay now I know I'm winning completely and a shake of hands and guys could you ever imagine that this game happened from the Petro defense that's gkes for you this game is a perfect illustration of how gkes can make anything interesting even watching pain try"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

with 1 E4 and that has been his goto move in this tournament E5 by Robbie and that is the most solid move at the top level Naka gets off his jacket makes himself comfortable and now adjusts all his pieces very carefully in his own time Robbie is just 22 years old he is from the Netherlands and let's see how this game goes Knight comes out to F3 and are we going to see a pet today not really Knight comes out to C6 and now Hikaru has an option between Italian Spanish he goes for the Italian Bishop C4 and one really enjoys the way in which Hikaru plays the Italian in round number two he managed to beat Chinese GM D Shang Ren in a nice game in the same opening now Bishop came out to C5 Hikaru plays his Pawn to C3 if you are not careful as black then D4 becomes a strong threat but Knight F6 is the best move and now you play D3 very calm move very slow very solid way for white to play now D6 by black and what is Hikaru going to do here is interesting because there are so many ways to continue playing he goes short castles and black can also Castle it out now of course it's possible but then you have to contend with the sharp Bishop G5 lines so that's the reason why Robie keep keeps the option open of castling and plays his Pawn up to A6 and Hikaru goes Pawn to A4 gaining space on the queen side very normal natural moves being played and now black plays short castles well Hikaru has many options here now he can go Bishop G5 he can go Rook E1 he can go H3 he can go Knight D2 he plays Rook E1 and this you know this ability to have so many options which have very very minute reasons is the reason why the Italian has gained so much prominence over the last few years at the top level earlier it used to be only Bishop B5 Ro Lopez that used to be played at the highest level but now the Italian has gained a lot of moment momentum okay Bishop E6 now decision time for Hikaru do you go Knight D2 and defend your bishop or do you take and let your opponent get doubled pawns this is actually a dynamic that needs to be studied carefully after Bishop takes Bishop because black gets a doubled Pawn here open file along with the bishop so it looks a little illogical right but on the other hand if you can't do much then a timely D4 will give white a nice position and Hikaru quickly puts his Bishop on E3 and this is something that he's well prepared his time is 1 hour 27 minutes in fact Robbie himself has 1 hour 34 minutes so he's also well prepared Rook takes on E3 and this has been seen before at the highest level in fact there's a game between aronian and mamed diaro which has gone this way D5 also was played in that game and that's why you you can see Robbie blitzing out his moves okay Hikaru needs to now think and he thinks for a couple of minutes not much 1 hour 26 minutes on the clock he plays Knight bd2 and pawn pushes forward to D4 H now you can't really move the Rook but oh you can actually move the Rook because if I take here take back Queen takes D3 there is Queen B3 with compensation but instead Hikaru just captures on D4 Robbie takes back and we have a new pawn structure here rookie two oh that's the new invention that Hikaru has because rookie one was played by Leon against midaro and that game ended in a draw pretty quickly so Hikaru goes Rook E2 Knight goes back to D7 Robbie seems to be still in some sort of preparation at least he knows the ideas well let's take stock of the situation black has a half open eff f file white has a half open C file so clearly it feels like White's structure is for choice because these Pawn structures are nice this Pawn structure is nice also the E6 Pawn is weak the B7 is under pressure he goes Queen E7 and now to note that if you go and greedily take this Pawn he wants to go Knight E5 and put pressure on D3 and that's the reason why Hikaru plays Rook C1 first he doesn't hurry into taking this Pawn on B7 Robbie still has 1 hour 31 minutes Hikaru is down to 1 hour 10 minutes and now finally after quite some thought he goes Knight to A5 now Hikaru had a good move here which is to go Queen A2 because the main move is C5 and here you can go this B4 breaking the position and then taking the pawn on D4 but Hikaru doesn't go for it he goes Queen A3 and which is also playable but I think black should be very happy with what he's got here because after the queen trade which Robbie does good move Queen takes A3 B takes e A3 very likely it's what his is going to be played yes B takes A3 and now push the pawn to C5 that is the plan yes Pawn comes up to C5 Rook to B1 now this move is very quickly played by Hikaru he puts his Rook on the open file but you can see that these two knights are controlling all the important squares and now Rook B8 has been played so maybe black can keep his Pawn on B6 with a very solid structure or he can get ambitious with the pawn to B5 move Hikaru says I don't like my position and I'm going to create play with E5 because he's made a Square for his Knight to jump to E4 looking at C5 and D6 squares Robbie goes for B5 he's going for the active play here this is very very exciting now because the game is going to get very sharp and with B5 you can literally sense from Robbie's Body Language that he wants to fight for the full point here ab and now hearu wants to take back uh sorry Robbie can take back with the pawn as well as with the Rook he takes his time and takes back with the pawn very natural very very fine now how should Hikaru continue here does he go Knight E4 yes he plays Knight E4 he he gets this move on the board and with this Rook looking at B5 the Knight looking at C5 and The Rook joining in to put pressure on B2 or C2 this is starting to get quite double-edged Rook B6 played by Robbie he wants to maybe get his other Rook into the game on C8 or B8 Hikaru plays Rook to C2 and now there are two attacks how do you defend this Pawn because if you go Rook C8 you're just losing a pawn to Knight takes D4 so clearly that is impossible and in fact Robbie finds the only move to keep the balance which is C4 very interesting if you take on D4 I have C takes D3 and that is enough counterplay here because the E5 Pawn is also hanging after R so Hikaru maybe has to decide how exactly he's going to play here he takes on C4 black has two good moves here one is to take with the Knight here the other is to play D3 because after Rook C B2 you take here you take here take here take here and then just Rook A8 and black is doing very well but Robbie instead of playing D3 goes Knight takes C4 and Hikaru has to be careful because this is hanging now on A3 so he goes Rook D1 and perhaps it was at this moment that black should take here I believe Hikaru would have taken take Rook D4 and the position although slightly better for white would have been equal but look at what Robbie has done he's sacrificed an exchange insane and you can see Hikaru is slightly surprised he's like what why did you sacrifice an exchange I don't understand and you can see that expression on his face okay Robbie wants to take here but the point is you've given up a rook and it's not like the position does not have open files well it's actually a very big gift for Hikaru because you know all this while he was trying to create play trying to get counterplay uh and hoping that he could sort of uh do something in the position but now with this Exchange sacrifice he has to do nothing he has to just keep control D3 played but of course just Rook C3 don't hurry and after Rook C3 oh he goes Rook A2 which is also playable and now when the Knight moves away you can chop off this pawn and that's exactly Knight G6 played by Robbie and now Rook takes B3 uh D3 yes he takes the pawn okay if you look at the position objectively black has a knight and a pawn for a rook however the existence of these two pawns gives white a big winning chance because if you trade off these two pawns the knights would do very well because pawns are only on one side of the board but the moment you have pawns on both sides of the board The Rook becomes so much superior to the Knight Knight D5 played by Robbie here here and how does Hikaru create play A4 is not really working because you're trading pawns so he goes Knight to C3 which is a very logical move and he wants to trade the Knight because otherwise the B5 Pawn is hanging so Knight takes Knight and now the Rook will take the Knight yes Rook takes C3 and now this Knight is shaky now A4 becomes a real threat because then the Knight would be hanging so he plays Rook A6 putting pressure here also very careful on how do you want to proceed here as white hearu goes Rook to B3 and now a very important thing to notice here is that this Pawn needs to be protected so Rook A5 must be played at all cost Robbie has 10 minutes to work this out and he mustn't hurry to make his move he goes King F7 with just 30 seconds of thought and this is not a good move because now the problem is that after Rook takes Pawn here firstly you cannot take with the Knight because then it would be a pin so actually Hikaru takes and now this is a very important thing to learn from from this game so first Hikaru takes the pawn now you need to take this with the Rook as we mentioned because Knight takes runs into Rook B3 so Rook takes and now once you take with the Rook look at what Hikaru does now takes the Rook Knight takes back and this position would be a draw if the Knight was back there but Rook C5 Rook standing one square diagonally to the Knight dominates the Knight here you can see the Knight does not have good squares it's trying to escape now imagine if the Knight went here players could almost sign the score sheets it's a draw but Hikaru plays Knight d uh sorry Pawn to F3 which means that once again even though the Knight is trying to escape you've taken away a very key Square from it Rook goes back to B3 and now the threat is to go King here King here and actually trap the knight in some ways E5 played the pawn is coming in to help the Knight and that's good thinking by Robbie because Pawn to E4 is important yes good move because now the Knight takes Pawn if you take the pawn there would be a fork but Hikaru has seen it all he plays Pawn to F4 and the game is over you know this from the body language of Hikaru of course you shouldn't be impacted by the opponent's B body language so much but even the position clearly tells us that black is now lost King E3 and Hikaru this is easy for him because he's going to take the pawn on e4 then he's going to move in with his Rook push the black king back and eventually create a zuk Zang like situation where black does not have any moves this is um you know bread and butter for a player like Hikaru he can do this All Night Knight H4 and now King takes E4 he can just chop off the pawn yeah takes the pawn and also for black to trade pawns is not possible it's it's almost impossible that he he gets to trade the pawns and uh yeah Knight goes back to G6 Rook check maybe Rook to B Rook to C7 check could be an idea he plays Pawn to F5 H the Knight is being now just sent away where does it go Robbie plays his Knight to f8 and the King can keep moving further in or actually you can start off with a rook check well Hikaru uh decides that he wants to play Pawn to H4 and actually even though this position does look completely winning it would be instructive to see how to win it because it's not so simple like if you give a check the king moves here if you give another check the king moves back if you come up forward the Knight gives you a check so there's still some sort of Fortress like possibilities Rook check and now you'll see that the G Pawn is hanging here on G7 so the King has to move King F6 played and now Hikaru can give another check to push the king away backwards and maybe this was the reason why he played H4 so that when this check is given the king cannot go to G5 that square is controlled by him so the king comes back to F7 and maybe it's time to take even more space with H5 yes the pawn moves forward and maybe the next MO is H6 creating a passer on the f file he plays his Pawn to H6 and Hikaru now ready with his next move and I think this is the move which creates the Breakthrough he goes H F6 very nice if you take the pawn then the king moves in Rook will take this Pawn Rook check King will enter here it is losing losing so he goes G6 but now if you think about it black hardly has any moves like yes taking here doesn't make much sense but Rook A6 and now it's losing because if you move the king away H takes G6 and King F5 if you play the Knight here H takes G6 is coming and so Robbie resigns here with the final move what a nice game by Hikaru actually uh and I think they discussed with each other and let's try to listen to this analysis session is yeah have to go see op that's something just I can just take back

plays D6 pranesh brings his Knight out to C3 and Magnus now plays C6 so you can see he's playing three pawn moves trying to confuse his opponent but pranesh is not at all getting confused he's just blitzing out his moves he plays Bishop E3 and tells Magnus that I'm not really worried about your opening and gets off from the board so there's no one at the board in the first after first four moves of the game Magnus comes back and now plays his Knight out to F6 so some kind of a move order that Magnus has chosen there could be idea of Knight G4 hitting the bishop so pranesh has to decide on what way he wants to continue well he simply goes F3 and stops that knight from jumping to G4 it's a nice little move so now it's also a very aggressive setup because generally you want to put your queen on D2 long Castle G4 H4 H5 just like the Sicilian dragon is how you want to continue what is Magnus going to play now he goes B5 and you will see that Magnus does not develop his Bishop to G7 instantly because he knows that Queen D2 Bishop at6 can happen at some point and he doesn't want to lose that Tempo oo H5 Magnus is actually going for this sort of light squared strategy because if you see his pawns they are all on light squares right now and that's how he's playing this he brings his Knight to D7 so while pranesh has kind of started developing all his pieces two pieces out and so on Magnus hardly has got any pieces out he's just playing with pawns but look at pranes he plays F4 he wants to maybe break with F5 that could be his idea he's going very aggressive and that's how he likes to play you know pranesh is an aggressive player also with the pawn moving up to to F4 he's freed the square F3 for his Knight the Knight could move out here and so Magnus now taking his time he needs to decide what to do one idea is B4 the other one is to go Knight B6 and that is a very interesting move because you keep an eye on the C4 Pawn he plays it Knight B6 keeps an eye on the C4 square and also later on opening up the bishop and there's also another idea which should be very very interesting and that is by the way Knight F3 played and that is to play D5 o he first goes B4 which is logical and now the Knight is attacked so one one way is to go back to D1 but it's slightly passive instead we could go Knight E2 yeah Knight comes to E2 and now the Knight can jump to C4 attacking the bishop but he goes D5 and this actually now clarifies magnus's opening strategy completely CU he's playing for the light squares E5 played by pranesh and you will see that Magnus has made 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 pawn moves out of 10 and now goes Bishop G4 hitting the Knight the Knight has has to be defended so the most logical move now is to play Bishop G2 and that's what he does he plays his Bishop to G2 and black would want now to eventually go E6 and C5 he plays his Pawn up to E6 so very solid structure you can see that black has such a solid structure and also the ability to break with C5 this is a fantastic position for Magnus Carlson here and he will most likely get an opening Advantage also his Bishop now can be simply given up for the Knight Bishop takes F3 Bishop takes F3 so while black has a very active plan with C5 coming up not exactly now but with Knight D7 and C5 what is White's breaking plan like what is the pawn break that white is looking for it's not so clear at all in fact white has to play for F5 breakthrough at some point which is impossible because there are two pawns but maybe it's a pawn sacrifice that has to be looked into so Knight D7 played by Magnus and humanly this position looks really very very comfortable for black he goes H4 just saving his pawns connecting them all together Bishop E7 played by Magnus in fact here Rook C8 oops Rook C8 or C5 or Knight C4 was maybe also possible now he goes short Castle so pranesh puts his King on G1 it looks little loose there because of so much space around it but also it's not very easy to get to the king Rook C8 played by Magnus now so Magnus taking it easy for the C5 break not rushing into into it and pranesh goes C3 he connects his pawns but on the other hand the C4 square is going to get really weakened yes C Knight C4 played here the bishop has to move away Bishop C1 played and somewhere you might ask yourself that white seems to be completely in trouble here it has no moves but as is rightly pointed out by very strong players that F5 is a very legitimate idea in such positions it's not just a pawn sacrifice but it breaks apart black structure for the time being Magnus has taken on C3 and pranesh takes back now you can see the Knight is very well positioned on C4 it's a complete Outpost the Knight cannot be kicked Away by any of the pawns there and one of the reasons why Magnus is not willing to go C5 because let's say if you go C5 here is because then F5 becomes really strong idea in such positions so that's the reason why he plays the move Rook B8 now King H1 played by pranesh and Magnus plays his Queen to A5 attacking the C3 Pawn here keeping an eye on it and pranesh goes Queen D3 white is kind of waiting for the time for the right time for F5 break and Magnus goes Bishop A3 because he wants the control of the B2 Square now Bishop E3 is not a good move because black can go Bishop B2 can also go Rook B2 or can also go Knight B2 all pieces going to B2 is a good idea but Magnus takes on E3 and that is not a great idea because now Magnus has given white a great opportunity well it might seem on one hand that after Queen takes E3 you can bring another Knight here which is exactly what Magnus does but pranesh has some ideas now one of them is that he can go Rook B1 and keep this Knight pinned and uh it's such positions where pranesh becomes very difficult to face he plays Rook B1 he has 51 minutes on the clock Magnus has 59 minutes so Magnus plays his King to D7 he connects his Rooks and is angling now to go Knight to C4 that is his plan but pranesh pushes his Pawn to F5 who what a break here if G takes F5 he might want to go Knight F4 and start attacking this Pawn but if e takes F5 is what Magnus plays this is again a very risky move because now you don't have the H5 weakness here but E6 becomes possible and pranesh gives another Pawn he is on an aggressive streak playing against the strongest player on the planet that requires some guts F takes E6 and where is pes's compensation he's two pawns down how is he going to recover his material is the question well the Knight will jump to F4 and that seems the most logical move he has played Knight F4 attacking E6 and G6 pawns and Magnus brings his Rook to E8 defending the pawn on E6 now if you were to play Knight takes G6 immediately then the Black Knight would settle in on C4 and so pranesh here takes his time and again finds the best move a prophylactic move stopping Knight C4 Magnus goes Bishop D6 attacking the Knight and clearly wants to take it off uh but pranesh does not allow it he takes the pawn on G6 Magnus plays his Knight to C4 he has 41 minutes pranesh also has 41 minutes here and I think it's a good time for the Knight to be kicked off by the bishop you can just take it off yeah he takes on C4 and now after D take C4 Magnus has got a good Square for his Queen on D5 if you count the number of pawns for the time being white has Five Pawns black has six but after Knight E5 check you can see that the G Pawn is a protected passer it's a very strong pawn and uh yeah white has good compensation if you take Bishop E5 D5 the pawn would be well positioned here and The Rook could enter there so Magnus plays King C6 but now pranesh again has a strong idea here at his disposal it's not an easy position to play but I think he should be able to find it he goes Knight F7 fine move there fantastic he wants to take on D6 also the E6 Pawn is weak and I believe this move is not something that Magnus was expecting he gives a check after 20 minutes of thought that's a long long think and he gives a check here pranesh has to move his King it Fields after Queen D5 check he brings his King to the side and now this Knight is so trickily placed because it can take the bishop also at the same time no one really can attack that Knight so easily Magnus plays F4 and this is not not particularly a great idea but okay it's a playable move Queen F2 played and now Rook takes Rook seems okay Rook takes rook and you push your Pawn to F3 yeah he takes the Rook pranesh can recapture back yes and now black can push his Pawn to F3 that seems like a good move that keeps the balance in the position what should White do after F3 is the question but will Magnus play F3 is down to 15 minutes no he goes rook f8 and that is a mistake because if you have to take the bishop King takes D6 is fine but there is a very powerful intermetzo here pranesh who has 35 minutes on the clock thinks and plays Queen B2 instantly without much thought because if you take here there's Queen B7 check it could be a move that Magnus has missed no he goes C5 defending here the queen and now the Knight takes the bishop King takes on D6 but the king is looking exposed not at all a good position a good sign Queen A3 love the move attacking the C5 Pawn the best move now for black is Rook eight but it's very very complicated to find such a move Magnus goes Queen F5 and this is a mistake now this is technically a winning position for pranesh but it's so tough first you have to give a check he makes the first move correctly King D5 is forced because if you go backwards The Rook will move in with a check and it's Devastation so King D5 played by Magnus Carlson and now pranesh where does he go and give a check you can see Hikaru there on the far side trying to look at what's happening in the game and pranesh has got magnus's King on the Run he gives a check fantastic move King has to move back if only the Rook could enter here it was game over but it's not so simple to get that square how do you coordinate your pieces he takes the pawn on C5 D takes on C5 you can see pranesh getting excited because if King takes then there's Rook B5 check and you lose the queen he takes takes on C5 with the queen now important is that you don't go to these squares because of Queen D5 check and you trade Queen so he goes King F1 which is the correct idea once again now there are no checks in the position and Magnus only move is Queen D5 he plays it to stop Rook D1 check and if the Queens are traded then black has absolutely no problem so Queen B4 this is not the best move the right idea was Queen A6 and Then followed by taking the pawn on A7 because King E5 that is Rook B5 but instead he goes Queen B4 and Magnus goes King E5 but now isn't The Rook hanging there on f8 has Magnus blundered you can see pranesh looking a little surprised little shocked he goes Rook e one check King F5 played and this is actually shocking because Magnus is giving up the Rook with a check I'm sure that Magnus saw all of this King goes to G4 and now the plan is King is coming into G3 Queen D3 check Queen here it's very powerful he goes Rook E2 which seems The Logical move but black is now maybe even pushing a bit because F3 you can't move the Rook if you go with the Rook anywhere Queen D1 check is a big problem to face so pranesh finds this excellent defensive move Queen F6 which is very commendable because after sort of feeling that you are better to find a move like Queen F6 which helps you to hold the game is not at all easy F takes on E2 check now the King has to take back the pawn yes he takes King E2 and offers a draw to Magnus Carlson there and Magnus will accept the draw because the G Pawn is extremely powerful well he does not he gives a check Magnus still wants to win it's not going to be easy King to F2 played and now Magnus pushes his Pawn but this Pawn is way too slow the fastest Pawn is the G Pawn which is just three squares away from becoming a queen and so pranesh taking a final think in the position he goes G6 and he knows that Magnus cannot conjure up counterplay in these few moves that are there two more moves for his Pawn to Queen so Queen C2 check played the King has to move away where exactly do you move it he goes King G1 and now you have to give a check from the last rank Magnus gives Queen B1 check and pranesh now has to move his King he goes King G2 and it seems like the repetition is incoming because white does not want to uh you know his Pawn is very much Advanced meanwhile black has the activity with with this queen and king but it is not enough to win the game Queen E4 check played and now pranesh plays King F2 and I think it's time for the players to agree to a draw Magnus now offers a draw and with this 17-year-old pranesh holds Magnus to a draw in a very exciting encounter a huge congratulations to him [Music] change [Music] [Music] go the get this what [Music] [Music] than [Music] by"}, {"instruction":

Barat held Magnus to a draw will bat also manage to do so with the black pieces things get considerably harder against the world number one you can see him carefully adjusting his pieces but bat is an amazing talent he became a GM at the age of 14 and now at the tender age of 16 about to turn 17 soon he is a phenomenal player E4 played by Magnus and bat responds back with E5 this is going to be an interesting opening battle because bat does not like to play very conventional openings he likes to keep it sharp he likes to go for new ideas so when he's played E4 E5 I don't think he'll play the main lines Knight comes out to C6 and Magnus plays Bishop C4 now bat generally does not go for Bishop C5 lines here he plays Knight to F6 and Magnus now plays his Pawn to D3 will bat Play Bishop C5 and surprise Magnus this time not really he goes H6 now this move looks like sort of played against Knight G5 like stopping that move but not really it's a very well established moon now and black often wants to go G5 in such lines bat first plays the pawn up to D6 and now Magnus I think the simple way for him to start playing is to play C3 B4 and so on well he goes A4 first gaining space on the queen side now one thing to remember for white is not to make a move like H3 like for example if you play a move like H3 then G5 G4 becomes very strong by the way G6 played by bat he wants to play his Bishop to G7 and Castle Magnus moves his Pawn to C3 you can see how he's getting ready for the struggle there can be a pawn push to D4 they can also be B4 Pawn push Bishop goes to G7 now if white wants to play D4 his Pawn should be defended so Knight D2 makes complete sense and now bat castles it out so we are seeing a very interesting battle Brew up B4 played by Magnus he has 1 hour 20 minutes on the clock while bat still is at 131 which means he's very well prepared now as Magnus gains space on the queen side bat plays King at7 and he's like I want to maybe go for the F5 break that seems to be his idea rookie one again nice centralizing move Knight H5 whoa bat subramanyam wants to go F5 use the Knight on F4 Open up The Rook the bishop moves in but Magnus very quietly plays B5 notice if you play Knight E7 there's D4 and then there's no way to play F5 because white has really good play in the center that's the reason why bat plays Knight A5 and attacks the bishop the bishop has to move back and that gives the move for Barat to play F5 at least he's in time to get this move F5 however what he's not in time for is what Magnus is going to do next notice very carefully how Magnus plays here the the way in which he sort of quenches Black's attacking prospects is just a joy to watch now bat is down to 48 minutes on the clock Magnus takes his time because it's a crucial decision he takes the pawn now on F5 notice if you take e g takes F5 there is Knight takes pawn and the Knight is hanging also if you take with the Rook there is Pawn up to G4 for King so that's the reason why bat takes with the bishop but now comes the powerful move d4 and black cannot take here cannot push the pawn if he takes there is Knight takes D4 with an advantage because the bishop can drop back and so with the Knight out on A5 Black's position is getting very dangerous but bat says even without the Knight I have enough pieces to launch an attack that's why he goes Knight F4 but now Magnus goes for this very nice move Knight E4 this is excellent move it opens up the bishop also provokes D5 which would destabilize black center and bg4 move meets Knight G5 and you are going to lose the bishop so bat plays D5 he plays it actively here which is a good idea but it actually fails because of certain tactics Bishop F4 very good move if you take back the bishop I go Knight C5 I attack here but most importantly I'm looking at the E6 Square so bat doesn't want that he takes on e4 notice if you take D there's Knight takes E5 so Bishop takes and now magnus's Bishop is attacked but he can take the pawn so he's now a pawn up but B's idea was this he wanted to spoil magnus's Pawn structure and this is exactly the reason why he played this but Magnus really does not care he takes with the pawn he says this is an extra Pawn you don't have pieces in the attack my Bishop is well placed and this should be good enough for me to actually win this game bat plays his KN now to C4 that's a good decision because the Knight was out of the game for the missing Pawn he needs to show some compensation and Magnus very quickly goes Bishop G3 Magnus has 1 hour 5 minutes while bhat is down to 20 minutes also the time usage is a very good indicator of how confident Magnus is here Magnus is fully confident in his abilities H5 played he wants to maybe hit the bishop with H4 and then could get the queen in but Magnus stops it with H4 and if you play Bishop F6 to hit the pawn I'm going to take take and put my Rook here to defend so A6 played here by bat trying to create play on The Queen side and let's see how Magnus converts this there's a lot to learn from magnus's conversion skills he first takes the Knight on C4 D takes C4 we are on move number 21 and B just has 10 minutes left to make the remaining 19 moves and notice this beautiful Pawn structure which limits Black's Bishop Queen comes out to E2 attacking the pawn on C4 how does white continue here well black first takes on B5 Magnus takes back so he's still attacking this Pawn but I think bat has a nice move here he thinks a bit and yes he finds Queen D5 so with this move he's looking at F3 he's looking at B5 these are very good squares to look at but Magnus first plays his Queen to E4 and he tells parat that look if you take here I'm just a pawn up and completely winning so you can't you will have to do something else here and bat takes the pawn on B5 well it's a kn nice healthy Pawn that he's captured the material is equal but of course Magnus has seen it how that how should he recover the pawn and not just recover but activate his position even further so for that first either you can go Rook B1 which is a good move and win the pawn on B7 but you can also take take and now bring your Rook to B1 attacking the B7 Pawn you will see that that with every trade White's Advantage keeps growing because that's how Magnus is placing his pieces Rook B1 fantastic move now you want to win this Pawn then the C7 Pawn then you are closer to the black king and notice the king is not very safe it's all lonely there while the white king does look exposed but has a lot of space here to move oh Queen A5 played he's looking at the C3 Pawn so now things are getting sharp because bat says that if you take my Pawn here which Magnus does I will take your Pawn on C3 bat just has 2 minutes left on the clock right now Magnus has 52 minutes it's now turning into a fist fight Rook takes C7 bat goes in for a check is this going to be a massive attack here because if you now now he'll go King G2 and if you go Queen C1 trying to threaten a mate there is some some trouble because of Rook takes on G7 and I think Magnus has figured it out that it's winning for him so that's the reason why after King G2 bhat has to work out because the threat is Rook G7 King G7 Queen check and it leads to a mate so he goes Rook e one taking away the eventual E7 Square for the queen to check and still Magnus is winning after take take Bishop E5 although the calculation is not at all easy but Magnus blunders here with Queen D5 5 I wouldn't call this a blunder but a big mistake because now bat can play Queen D3 when Magnus is forced to take here and this end game is not as easy to convert but bat misses it he plays Queen C1 he plays this and he's hoping for check check and trying to mate the white king but it will not work so easily because Magnus has a very nice defensive move here he takes his time he has a lot of time he plays Bishop H2 he stops Rook G1 check and it is all over the position is now winning because there's no real way to launch the attack just like that Magnus has managed to convert this well you may want to go Rook H1 trying for Queen F1 or something but already there's no real threat I can even go here you check I come up and there's no more checks left so that's how useful the bishop is on H2 bat is now having very little time on the clock last 30 seconds left for him he needs to play his move and he goes Rook E2 very tricky indeed because if you move your queen up trying to Checkmate him bat wants to take on F2 King F2 Queen check and it's actually a Perpetual look at this take take check and now if you go King G3 check King King F4 is of course not a good idea because there's check and King E4 leads Queen D4 check and there's a Perpetual here completely out of the blue but Magnus still goes for it he goes Queen F7 and what has he in mind actually bat can take on F2 will the youngster do it that seems like a good move yes he takes on F2 but now Magnus cannot take it if he takes it it's a draw the world number one oh he has this move King G3 prepared the king moves up and then no more checks here wow that was very smart because now if Rook takes F3 there is Queen takes F3 and your Rook up and bat does not really have a move left for himself he's getting checkmated here and that is a big problem he has to figure out how to defend his Bishop that there are no more checks left in the position so he comes back Queen H2 hoping that Magnus gets tempted to take the Rook when again Queen D2 is a draw but of course Magnus has no such intention he takes on G7 first and after Queen takes G7 Rook takes on G7 he will be a piece up what a great great game by Magnus Carlson actually apart from a couple of slips towards the end I think he played so well he understood the position so well bat's kingside attack was just very nicely diffused and now he has won the game with this he'll move on to three and a half out of five bat resigns and Magnus has won

Cup as well and at that point it was gkes who knocked out Naran with a score of one and a half half will Naran get his revenge here D4 Knight to F6 C4 played actually it's a very interesting Clash of styles but at the same time Naran and gukesh have some similarities in their play they both love to calculate and they are kind of machines when it comes to calculations Knight comes out to F3 and gukesh plays the Queen's Gambit declined with D5 in fact gukesh always loves to convert things into Rago in territory by playing Bishop to B4 will he do that no he first plays his Knight to D7 and this is a very subtle way to play the Queen's Gambit decline because you're not really determining the position of your Bishop C takes D5 played by Narayanan he takes the pawn in the center gukesh captures it back and now this bishop can go to E7 D6 B4 depending on the way in which white plays so white goes Bishop G5 pins the Knight now a normal move would be Bishop E7 to stay in the Queen's Gambit declined territory but gkes of course goes into the Rago in now with Bishop to B4 pinning the Knight and this is something that I'm sure Naran is well prepared because this is one of gish's main repertoir moves so he goes Knight D2 now with this move he's breaking the pin and also idea like H6 G5 Knight E4 all of this no longer happening so C6 played by gkes he's still in his prep and now white can develop the bishop with E3 yes the bishop will come to D3 which is a good Square for it to sit on how is gkes going to continue next he plays his Knight to f8 very interesting move notice what he wants to do he wants to go to G6 and then kick the bishop when the bishop can no longer stay on this diagonal this does remind us of lines of the Italian or the Spanish you know where the knight from B1 goes to D2 to F1 to G3 in the same way gk's Knight is going to G6 exactly he's gone to G6 here we have seen this in previous games before being played and Nar now I guess would love to Castle it out perhaps yes he castles it and now I was wondering if H6 makes sense but the problem is that after take Queen takes there is this very nice Moon Knight takes pawn pawn takes and check which creates problems so H6 is not possible just as now but castling is a good move A3 now Naran first tells gukesh give me your bishop and if you take I want to take back and later strike in the center with C4 so gkes goes back with his bishop and now the bishop is angling towards the H2 Square what does Naran do he is already taken 14 minutes on the clock which shows that perhaps he's not in his prep or maybe he's still in his prep and he recollected all the moves F4 wow that's a very interesting move because he he wants to perhaps push F5 H6 played by gukesh and I think Naran has to now part away with his Bishop there's no other way he takes on F6 Queen takes F6 now the E3 Pawn has become weak but on the other hand the Knight can switch and go here so F5 definitely should be considered when you have to calculate these moves like Queen G5 but Naran plays Knight F3 which is kind of a soft move and gkes has this nice opportunity to trade these Bishop with Bishop F5 and I believe his position is completely fine you know black has no problems out of the opening the bishop will sit well on F5 however gkes is tempted by Bishop G4 and the reason is I think that he doesn't want the Knight to come to E5 which means that the pawn on E3 remains a bit weak and he can actually go and double down on this Pawn so it's a deep concept but at the same time you have to part away with your Bishop because otherwise he's once again threatening to come to uh E5 he takes it now the thing is with Bishop takes F3 Rook takes F3 you've given away an important bishop and while statically black is doing very well the E3 is weak and you can double up you know dynamic Ally white has great attacking chances especially with moves like G4 G5 and you will see that Nar and O he goes King H1 and maybe he's preparing Rook to G1 and then going G4 G5 wo that could be really a huge attack coming up but gkes continues with his idea of doubling down the E file and putting pressure on this Pawn which is backward and weak Naran brings his Rook to F1 I was wondering if Rook to G1 would make sense also because then you are threatening G4 it is possible but Naran has for the time being kept his Rook on F1 Rook E8 played E3 is hanging and now the Knight can actually go back and defend it and notice how The Rook has actually gone on the other side so this Knight which comes back and defends the pawn is no longer breaking the coordination of white pieces gkes goes Knight f8 he has 57 minutes on the clock Naran has 48 minutes G4 whoo Naran is fearless he goes G4 and he's onto the attack now Queen G2 G5 gkes you can see has t for nearly 22 minutes he's now down to 33 on the clock he's not comfortable with his position he plays his Pawn to G6 here and the queen goes to G2 I get a feeling that although Black's pieces look pretty well positioned it's white who is calling all the shots Queen G7 and now Naran can already break through with this move F5 it looks so powerful if you take I take with the rook and it's totally better but Naran plays the other Pawn push which is also very good he goes G5 and his point is that if you play F5 uh sorry H5 now I go F5 so gukesh cannot really push he takes the pawn and now Naran can take back with the pawn opening up the file yes he takes it now The Rook has opened up putting pressure on the F7 Pawn how does kukesh continue here he's so passive and you know his two Rooks Ambitions are being stopped by this one Knight defending the pawn gkes goes Knight to H H7 and pawn moves up to H4 very nice move Naran slowly and steadily building the attack maybe Rook H3 H5 is on the cards so gkes gets a little bit impatient and go C5 one good idea is Knight F2 because CD4 Knight G4 D3 Rook F7 and Knight at6 check coming up would have been a nice way to play but he goes Bishop B5 attacks The Rook Rook f8 much better but gkes goes rook d8 and now can Naran find this epic move which is Knight to C3 which attacks the pawn on D5 and he finds it what a move it's not so easy to defend this Pawn because if you move your Bishop away you can lose this Pawn or also get into some brutal tactics like these so gkes takes on D4 and he attacks the Knight Naran can take the pawn back but then Queen takes D4 and black is actually doing very well so he takes on D5 attacks The Rook there's no discovered attack on the Knight so The Rook has to move gukesh goes Rook E4 attacking the H4 Pawn if you look at the time gukesh has 8 minutes Naran has 15 minutes on the clock and now this very cool move Rook H3 defending the pawn also unleashing an attack on The Rook so Naran is totally better now he's actually going to win a pawn now Rook E5 but well the Knight is defended and I'm going to take this out yes e takes D4 and Naran has now 8 minutes so as so also gkes both have 8 minutes but Naran is completely winning Rook F5 played by gkes but you can take the rook and spoil black structure Naran takes Pawn takes and you can see like a move like Knight E3 Knight F5 black is in big trouble because your Pawn down your structure is also bad so for Gish this is a very tough one Queen F2 attacking the pawn here on F5 you have to defend it he goes Rook C8 and he tells that if you take here then after I give a check it's already a lot of counterplay because the queen is coming in so that's the reason why Naran instantly trades The Rook fantastic move once again and I think you should take back with the pawn bolstering your Center Central Pawn there yes your A3 Pawn is a little weak now and the bishop can come and take it but this is also hanging so first gukesh saves this pawn and I think the best move here is to go back with your bishop and attack it once again Naran finds the best move he goes back Bishop D3 and attacks the pawn on F5 gkes now goes Queen E6 4 minutes 33 seconds 34 moves have been played six more moves before the players get 30 minutes extra on the clock will gukesh manage to survive Naran makes a mistake pushing the pawn in fact Knight E3 would have been so strong because then the Knight sits here on a beautiful square but instead he goes C4 and gkes finds the best move F4 threatening check Queen must drop back and stop this because that is a massive threat but Naran wants to take the pawn this is not a good move because now gukesh can go Queen G4 attack the Knight and also have all sorts of threats now here this position black is back no but Gish takes on F4 that is one miss there because GES generally fantastic at defense King takes H7 Queen takes F4 and we go into a queen end game now where Naran has still excellent chances to convert because he's two pawns up right now okay gkes will capture back one of the Pawns we are on move number 38 so he takes on C4 well objectively this might be holdable but in a practical game it's very tough Narayanan goes H5 that is a good move he's using his pawns to push the king back and then he also has a deep passer gkes must start galvanizing his Queens side pawns and that's exactly what he does with B5 because if he can quickly create a passer on the queen side he will be in the game but if he cannot then white already has a lot of Pawns moving up Queen E4 check and now we have hit move number 40 King G8 and a question o gkes does plays this King to G8 things he's like I still have 1 minute 26 seconds I must be very careful because in a queen end game where you move your king is going to determine the outcome of the game very important to move your king safely gkes just making sure that 1 2 and three which is the best option for him he goes King G8 that's the best now Naran is at Crossroads he like should I play with my pawns and queen or should I bring my king also into the game because it's an important question and I think take bringing the king in would be very good here but first he gives a check that's fine you can give some checks and keep the position as it is gukesh goes King to H7 and I think Naran must go back with Queen E4 then bring his King up and he still has excellent winning chances but he rushes into it he goes G6 and now the position is equal one move that gkes can play King at six but it's very tough to play this humanly this is still equal so he makes the more human move of taking the pawn queen takes on G6 King h8 played by gkes and uh the problem here for Naran is that his D Pawn is not moving forward so easily Queen F6 check so gukesh has to decide between here and here I believe putting your king here means that H6 Queen H7 Queen G7 could be made so he goes King H7 because now if you play H6 there is always this move Queen C7 uh trying to hold on so he plays Queen F5 check and now gukesh must not blunder into King at six Queen G6 mate he must keep uh a good move uh he should he goes King G7 that's a mistake King G8 was the best the reason why this is a mistake is subtle because the queen can get the e D5 square and it's a very important Square there D5 you will see the reason why this square is important is because D6 can come forward if you had gone King G8 it's not so simple after D5 to play D6 because there's a check and you lose the Pawn King G7 D5 A5 means that now Naran can actually give this check and play D6 he does it he gives this check that's why these end games are so subtle and so difficult because you have to see all these little checks King at6 played by gkes and now white can push the pawn to D6 it's it's so interesting that actually white king is not at all taking part in this entire thing that's happening Naran feels that his Queen and pawn is enough B4 gkes says if you now push the pawn I'm ready with a check to take this Pawn so you can't push it so meanwhile let me push my pawns Nar and first takes on B4 and I think ab4 is something that gkes will play yes Pawn takes B4 so now his Pawn is also just three steps away from queening although White's Pawn is just two steps away from queening first queen F6 check a mistake he had to find this only check that was winning which was Queen E3 but it's very tough to understand why exactly it's winning you know the queen has to take a certain Square now King H5 the problem is still D7 is met with check and you oh not check there but check here and you lose the pawn so Queen F5 check so you see he's taken control of this Square now gkes must move his King back which he does the position is equal and Naran now has to push his Pawn gkes is down to 5 minutes on the clock D7 played now the way to draw this game is to give a check Hing G1 and place the queen on D6 it's a tough way to defend because generally you want to keep giving checks but with this check gkes has spoiled the draw now he's losing the game because white Pawn is going to Queen well in some ways you feel the comfort of controlling this queening Square by putting your queen there but the queen is just too passive here and Naran now goes Queen E6 check he knows that he's winning he's actually manage to outplay gukesh in this very complicated End Game King G7 played and now there is King H3 which is a brilliant move because if you go here Queen G5 is a draw and so Naran finds this amazing move King H3 keeping his cool gkes push pushes the pawn to B3 but I think he's a bit too slow now Queen E8 means that there is no check gukesh goes Queen F6 but can I just not make a queen now well gkes is hoping that there is some Perpetual checks that he can give because his Pawn is still two steps away from queening but where is the per where is the Perpetual because he gives a check and now after King H4 the thing is if you give more checks my king moves forward and the queen can later on come in between to block the checks so Naran has won the game what a grandio struggle there between gukesh and Narayanan amazing and really like the fact that gukesh and Narayanan started analyzing instantly it's amazing to see them talk and discuss which means that win or losing more important than that is actually to understand where they went wrong and uh that is epic I leave you guys with watching them analyze maybe you might not be able to hear them so well but just soak in the spirit of the game just e that's e EX"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

game with one C4 his opponent rudik might be the strongest IM in the world with a rating of 2548 and he beat Anish giri in the last round C4 he responds with C6 are we going to witness the slow defense Knight comes out to f 3 and rudik might strike in the center with D5 it's always exciting to watch Arjun arig these games because you know he creates Chaos on the board and his opening preparation is often so so good E3 now this line is gaining popularity because white delays the pawn push to D4 and only does it when he feels that the lines will transpose in his favor so Knight to F6 and you will notice that Arjun won't go D4 instantly because that converts into Mainline slow so he plays his Knight to C3 and now there are many ways to continue E6 is one of them but rudik goes for A6 this is known as the chebanenko slow and here Arjun is happy to now convert it back into D4 territory so he plays his Pawn up to D4 rudik plays his Bishop to F5 he is well prepared but this is a very sharp line because now after Queen B3 your Pawn is hanging now one way to defend it is a slightly passive Rook A7 move uh but of course B5 makes all the sense I had once played this line with CD CD and A4 when there's a pawn sack but Arjun has nothing to do with that he plays his Pawn to C5 gains more space in the position rudik pushes his Pawn to A5 and maybe the idea a is that if you play A4 I can push B4 so Arjun goes Knight H4 and after now 10 minutes of thought rudik goes back Bishop C8 so one of his Bishop goes to the initial square and he presses the clock and Arjun plays F4 this is well this is still preparation territory for Arjun there are a few games which have continued with the move G6 here but after thinking for nearly 15 minutes rudik plays is Knight G8 unbelievable move his idea is E5 to hit the Knight here on H4 but now he comes back Knight F3 A4 attacking the Queen the queen goes back and look at Black's pieces all of them on the last square and G6 played now Arjun can go Bishop D3 and Castle but actually he goes Knight E5 and this is not a great idea because now rudik at some point can go Bishop G7 which he does Knight at6 castles F6 and E5 so arjun's Moon Knight E5 is not the best I would say but maybe Arjun has some ideas up his sleeve and one of them is to sacrifice on C6 and we will see if that works out or not Bishop E2 played by Arjun arigi and now black just castles it out will Arjun also Castle here I think makes sense or does he want to attack with G4 maybe that would be a bit too much because G4 F6 already kicks the Knight away so he castles it out and now Bishop goes to F5 nice move rudik actually fighting back after that very weird opening play that he did uh bringing all of his pieces to the last rank but now he's developed everything and goes F6 well for Arjun going back to F3 would mean his position is not that great and he sacks the Knight there for two points you can look at rudik there he's not even writing his score sheet he knew that this was on cards but you know when it happens you have to be ready to face it now Knight takes C6 the Knight takes and now the bishop takes the pawn attacking the Knight this Pawn is hanging and once that falls look at White's Queens side pawns they'll just start rolling down the board so what does rudik do Knight A5 is a is a decent move he goes Bishop G4 not the best idea because it allows Queen C1 f fantastic the point is that in some lines Knight takes D5 Queen takes D5 now Bishop C4 can be supported by the queen so this forcing the queen to C1 was not in Rudi's interests Knight A7 attacks the bishop here the bishop has to move away but I think Arjun can pick up another Pawn on A4 and then start rolling his pawns on the queen side with 47 minutes on the clock and this interesting position I think Arjun is firmly in the driver's seat now for rudik it's a must to activate these pieces here but it's not so easy to play E5 because this Knight D5 trick all the time keeps coming in so that's the reason why moving King h8 makes all the sense here and rudik does that he plays King h8 Arjun now should quickly start mobilizing his pawns but of course black will also mobilize in the center push it will get very messy and so Arjun plays Bishop B3 not a good move E6 played Knight comes to A4 all of a sudden you will see that with arjun's Bishop here on C B3 his pawns don't have the mobility that they wanted Bishop D1 that's why Arjun moves away the bishop and he hopes to trade it off Bishop takes on D1 now and queen takes D1 also happens this is E5 time now it's high time that uh rudik plays his Queen to uh sorry his Pawn to E5 no he goes Queen D7 perhaps it's fine because it's still attacking the Knight here the Knight is protected but now guys spare a thought for these pieces come on E5 no Queen C6 played he's playing with his Queen there when actually he needs to get his other pieces into the game and Arjun now goes Bishop C3 so he's happy in some ways that his Bishop is protecting this and stopping E5 but Rook A7 played why not Knight F5 here Queen comes to D2 well somewhere rudik needs to create play and maybe now the Play Lies with Bishop H6 G5 move here Knight B2 played by Arjun he wants to start pushing his pawns E5 played by Rudy in the center and now Arjun goes B4 he's going A4 A5 B5 now and you can see that rudix play is been a bit too slow he takes on F4 and Arjun takes it back he takes F4 and if black got a few moves like Knight F5 Rook E7 Rook E4 but still the bishop is trapped you know these Knight and Bishop both are not able to play in the game so rudik first plays Rook E7 because he doesn't know if his Knight should go to F5 or G4 he plays A4 well what should now black do because arjun's pawns are coming down like an avalanche there rookie four played but there's no stopping them B5 with every Pawn at once these are not three Pawns in fact they are three potential Queens so you can think of them as 27 points running down the board while rudik on the other hand is hoping to create some counterplay and Arjun just nips that in the bud he says no my dear friend you can't come to E2 I will simply trade it off so now how does black continue now he still has some four five moves in which he can do something or else arjun's pawns will start to advance even further Pawn takes Knight comes to C4 so Arjun not just playing with his pawns he's also bringing in his pieces maybe the Knight is angling at this square or just to blockade it with Knight E3 Knight E7 rudik wants to come with his Knight to D5 the other Knight to G4 will this convert into some kind of a play not really says Arjun I'm I'm very happy pushing my pawns A5 played the winter is coming Knight D5 attacking F4 and C3 Bishop you know F4 Pawn Arjun really doesn't care much because if you can take the F4 Pawn there's no threat after that so he pushes another Pawn to A6 the pawn is now just two squares away from queening rudik what are you going to do he goes Knight G4 now maybe the threat is E3 then the Knight you know there are all these little threats H3 played by Arjun pushing the Knight away and he pushes the pawn to E3 is there some final counter play coming in oh he takes on G4 Ah that's the point that is arjun's point and Arjun is so good at calculation even in the sharp lines he he is so well uh prepared with his moves e takes D2 and he takes on F5 and this Pawn is actually uh somehow telling black that look your Bishop can't be activated so he takes on C3 so now it's going to Queen actually Arjun can take here on D2 but then he loses his B5 Pawn which he does not want so he plays B6 and he tells his opponent my friend you can Queen you can do whatever you want look at rudic there because he knows if he Queens Rook takes Knight takes he will have a piece and a rook more but what about these two queens and here's a small little joke he makes a night there and presses the clock arjun's not on the board he knows he's and Arjun comes back he doesn't know what to do now because you know you can you can take the Knight but you can even let it go if it was a queen you would not have been able to so anyway treats it like a queen and takes on D1 and now rudik resigns the game because if Knight takes D1 there was B7 followed by A7 and B8 Queen what a game by these two players filled with so much of mess so much of ideas so much of content and let's see their analysis a bit sh"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess

brilliant matchup Wali has played phenomenally in this tournament she's beaten setu Raman shamid in wov gukesh on the other hand was on three and a half out of four but lost to SL Naran we have the shake of hands and we are about to begin gkes plays his Pawn up to C4 it's the English opening that he goes for and Vali would be very well prepared in the opening like she generally is she takes her time close to 30 seconds and plays E6 this is something that we've seen Vali doing also prag does it with it does it they take their time out of the opening maybe just get into the right frame of mind and look at GES taking 3 minutes for move number two just trying to assess what are the possibilities that that would lead to the kind of game that he wants to play today D5 played so we have the Queen's Gambit declined if gues goes D4 will he play it will he go into that Mainline stuff yes he does he plays D4 and now Wali Knight F6 very much likely to be played but instead she goes C5 ooh tarash defense and you can see there gkes looking at that move for a slightly second longer and trying to think what he should be doing he takes the pawn on D5 now this is a very interesting opening Choice by Wali the tarash defense leads to an isolated Queen Pawn because white will eventually take here or black will take here and that's what generally happens and it was one of the favorites of Gary Kasparov in the 1980s or so where he beat several players playing this with the black pieces but since then when he faced Anatoli carpo he stopped playing this because it is strategically a slightly dubious opening you are left with a weak pawn and I think against a player of carpo's caliber Kasparov did not dare trying it too many times however Vali thinks this is the right opening to be played against gukesh now the setup which gukesh has chosen with the fian shet of the bishop putting it on G2 is the main line uh the bishop is beautifully positioned to attack the D E5 pawn bishop E7 we are going into the main line territory and now the main move here is Knight to C3 Guk plays it and uh yeah now Castle seems like the most normal and natural move here exactly why shali castles it out now one of the lines is to take and but gkes goes Bishop G5 which is clearly the main line but this allows black an additional option one is to take take on D4 or first play H6 that's also no First Take on D4 but she plays C4 with this she's gaining space in the position and the main line now continues with 95 it's been played in several games but kukes plays E3 and this seems to be some preparation of his maybe an old preparation I don't think he would have prepared it one day before the game because there was no way to know that Wali would play the tarash so but look at wali's time she has 1 hour 31 minutes so she's clearly in his prep uh clearly in her prep Bishop E6 played by her and now gues goes Knight to D2 very interesting the main moves here are queen D7 Rook C8 but White's plan revolves around the move B3 to break the position and so Wali goes at6 maybe not the best move because clearly you want to take the Knight here you you if by going going back that doesn't seem very logical so takes takes and now B3 is what gkes will do because breaking that structure is a good idea now if black doesn't do anything white wants to take take and then have this very nice Pawn Center so Wali takes on B3 and this is already slightly inferior position one could take with the Knight or the queen both of them look very logical Knight takes looks even better because the Knight can jump to C5 uh and if you try to stop it with B6 the Knight can reroute itself this way but he goes Queen B3 which is also fine and I think the opening has been kind of slightly successful for gukesh now Knight A5 good move by Wali hitting the queen queen A4 looks like a very normal and natural move there but instead Queen B2 was played by gkes one of the positional advantages for white is that he has only two Pawn Islands while black has three here uh and the D5 Pawn is slightly weak and isolated and you will see that in the remainder of the game that that remains a very central part of this entire battle there are two attackers here two Defenders keep that in mind Rook C8 played by Wali maybe another interesting idea was to play this Rook but she goes for this one and now gkes realizes that he needs to increase the pressure on the D5 Pawn that is the reason why he plays A4 one idea is of course to clamp the B5 square but the other is to move the queen to A2 to attack the D5 Pawn why plays A6 to stop Queen B5 or Knight B5 or any such moves that are possible but now you can see gkes will go on with his idea of Queen A2 good move and he has 58 minutes on the clock wal is down to 38 minutes Rook d8 played to defend that pawn on D5 and how does gkes continue now he wants to maybe use this Knight and trade for this but the Knight could settle down on C4 Rook B1 played a useful move in the position and I think a very good idea now is to play O nice move by Wali this was exactly the move that I wanted Bishop p7 looking at the B4 square and the Knight could reroute itself there so fantastic Chess By Wali until now Knight E2 and now maybe just Knight C6 or First Trade on C1 trade on C1 and then Knight C6 looking at the B4 Square would be so good she takes on C1 very logical and Vali has 27 minutes on the clock gkes has 43 minutes Rook takes on C1 and now I think you could play G5 that is one idea stopping Knight F4 but Bishop B4 is not the best Knight C6 was really very cool because once your knight is placed here it's a very nice position for black instead Bishop B4 now allows Knight B3 an an interesting move because if Knight Knight C4 which Wali wants to play Knight F4 puts a lot oh she goes Knight C4 anyway regardless of that she goes Knight C4 and now gukesh can put his Knight on this Square which he does E6 is a little bit soft D5 is a little bit soft the Knight on C4 is not very stable Vali goes B6 and she tells gukesh your knight is not coming here how do you make progress is the question and not so easy to answer this question gukesh plays Knight A1 his idea is that he wants to go maybe Knight C2 Knight E1 Knight D3 that could be a plan Rook C8 Vali logical chess she's played 24 moves and matched gukesh move for move H4 and nice little move here by gukesh because G5 is always on the cards and he doesn't want that to happen so now his Knight on F4 is very well secured Bishop A3 great tactical move here if Rook takes C4 Rook takes C4 Queen takes A3 it leads to Queen takes A4 and black is still doing fine so gukesh doesn't indulge in that he goes to C3 with his Rook attacking here now Wali could have been bowled and taken this pawn it leads to loss of D5 Pawn but instead she goes Bishop B4 attacking The Rook The Rook comes back to C2 and now how do you continue this position one idea is to just drop back your bishop and try to take this Pawn uh this Knight but she goes B5 fine that's okay gukesh takes ab ab and now you can see the time pressure coming up for Wali she's down to 1 minute 53 seconds and gukesh has 26 minutes although Black's position is completely fine Wali has played this beautifully but this is where Guk starts to you know sort of create these tricks he's very very tricky in general okay why now what does she do she goes Bishop D2 provoking GES to take here take here take here this position is fine for white but it's very risky to give these two passers so gkes instead goes Rook B1 he's like I don't want to get into this business now Bishop F5 attacking The Rook would be a nice plan but she goes B4 and this is actually the big mistake in the game move number 30 turns into a error because now gkes goes Knight B3 attacking the bishop and planning to enter C5 Bishop C3 played and you will sense that with this Knight coming to C5 this Knight on F4 the bishop here there is too much pressure on these light squares so Vali now plays her Queen up and a good idea now is to take take put your Bishop here move your queen from this side and or from this side but gkes actually does nothing he builds up he continues building up the pressure he goes Rook C1 and Wali plays a rook to B8 so that is one of the things that gkes does very well is that he keeps building the pressure you know he's like this thing where uh he wants the whistle to blow in the pressure cooker at the final moment no small whistles there B3 and now a very good move is to take with this Knight Pawn takes and Knight takes here because D5 would also be hanging but actually gkes takes with the other Knight which is not very accurate and Bali plays a very nice move here B2 Rook B1 and now Knight D2 is a fantastic move leave alone those Knights you don't M it doesn't matter Knight D2 and the game still goes on Wali has 17 seconds in her hand she needs to figure it out no she takes here the final mistake of the game and I think now the game is over because now gkes has this powerful move Knight takes E6 which he finds in an instant Queen takes E6 the B8 is hanging and otherwise G7 mate is threatened so Wali takes it but yeah this is now game over because gkes chops off The Rook Queen takes B8 King H7 and the queen will come back and save everything in the position the bishop will be attacking uh would be attacked Queen B3 played by gkes and Wali played so so well she had some great chance you can see there gkes looking at the games above he knows that he's W here and queen F5 does attack the B1 Rook but E4 is a classy move classy move by GES uh now the queen is attacked and if the pawn takes the pawn which she does the bishop is hanging uh and so Queen takes on C3 played by gkes last trick for Wali involves with a pawn push attacking F2 and B1 but I believe gkes would have had a response prepared for that as well this is move number 40 we have reached so gukesh takes on B2 defending this he piece up even after Wali takes the rook and I think it's time to call it a day for Wali she played phenomenally well but in the end gukesh showed that he could handle the pressure better and uh gkes says why didn't you play Queen A4 when The Rook went to C3 that seemed like a good idea and he asks uh for analysis that was very nice of gkes they both actually work have worked together in the past at the West Bridge Anand chess Academy and also live in the same city of Chennai so I'm sure that uh it was a great great experience for Wali to play against GES and gkes with this moves to 4 and a half out of six and keeps his chances alive of winning this tournament"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the

Kd1 Be3 0-1", "output": "welcome everyone to the seventh round of the Qatar Masters 2023 we have kikan murli from India taking on Magnus Carson kikan is born in 1999 and he is currently rated 2611 His Highest ELO was 2637 we have the dignitaries who going to play the first move one E4 says Magnus and Magnus actually these days is telling the guests the move that he's going to play That's when interesting because some players tell the guest to make a move then take it back and then start so here you can see Magnus has played E4 and now gets all his pieces in order before pressing the clock very interesting kikan by the way is very well known for his ability to solve problems compositions he's very good which just goes to show that his imagination and speed speed of calculation is amazing for now we have E4 E5 Knight F3 on the board and karthikan goes for Knight to C6 we'll see what Magnus does here will he go for the Italian or the ru Lopez he goes for the ru Lopez here with Bishop to B5 and now kikan has to decide which line does he want to go to Berlin No he goes for A6 asking the question to the bishop well the bishop has to move Bishop A4 and we will see what is the line that is played Knight comes out to F6 both the players currently are on 4 and half points out of six so this is a very crucial game with three rounds to go the one who wins here would have an excellent chance of finishing on top of the table Knight to C3 now this is not a very common move and you can see that kikan actually takes a bit of time before playing B5 uh because the main line of course here is castles and you play your Pawn to C3 later and play D4 with Knight coming to C3 this plan is no longer possible but Magnus wants to play something which is slightly offbeat and could throw his opponent of his preparation but karthikan uh is making his moves pretty quickly Bishop C5 and maybe we can have a transposition to the archangle variation but not really Magnus wants to go in fresh territory he goes Knight D5 now if you take the pawn here I have a very strong move d4 and that's the reason why taking this Pawn is not a good idea kikan plays the move D6 he's down to 1 hour 18 minutes Magnus has 1 hour 28 minutes and he plays C 3 and the same idea persists he wants to go D4 here already it feels like white has a nice pleasant position out of the opening and now Bishop comes to E6 so this is not really a very wise way to play because now I can just Castle which is a good move and also play D4 which Magnus does and Strikes in the center and notice now you have to be very careful like if you take take and go which which kikan has done and Magnus is going to recapture here uh C takes D4 and now if you move your Bishop back to A7 You're simply losing the game after takes takes and pawn up to D5 with a fork so clearly you can't do that and so karthikan takes the knight in the center now here D takes C5 is met with taking on B3 and then the E4 Pawn is also weak so Magnus takes here and two pieces are attacked but karthikan comes out of it with a check and if you play Bishop D2 uh that's not what you want King F1 is an excellent move just imagine if you play Bishop D2 I take take Knight E7 black is doing very well but with King on F1 now you have this bishop alive and you can actually go Bishop G5 and pin it here that's the main thing okay maybe Knight D4 is an important move here but black has white has many moves like H4 is possible Magnus plays this slightly dubious move Queen D3 I do not like this move so much and kikian plays Queen D7 the main point is that the D5 Pawn is weak but if you take it it's going to open up the position for the white Bishop so Magnus actually does not even invest any time or effort in defend defending it he tells karthikan be my guest take the pawn and karthikan is saying that that pawn is mine to be taken at some point at the right point for now I'm just going to play my Pawn up to H6 H5 played by Magnus and he's actually daring kikan to go shot castles because then later on G4 G5 can be very strong so Magnus objectively is not making the best moves but psychologically is putting a lot of pressure sure now kikan takes the pawn on D5 this kind of opens up The Bishop's diagonal but for the time being these two knights are very solid and supporting each other they can't be moved uh and it's a nice formation wo Rook H4 by Magnus and I think he's preparing for the fact that if black shot castles he wants to go G4 G5 and that's the reason why he's brought his Rook here very interesting chess and kikan long castles wo did that come as a surprise to Magnus and karthikan is down to 17 minutes on the clock so now the position is very dangerous because white can actually break on the queen side with A4 but first Magnus plays A3 asks the question to the bishop that you need to move the bishop moves back and now you can strike in the queen side with A4 and that is exactly what Magnus does so if you play B4 the the A6 Pawn is hanging so you can't push the a file is going to open up is this trouble time for black not really says kikan he says that my Bishop here my Knights here are actually limiting your pieces and your Rook on H4 is doing nothing much even if you take on B5 I'll take back and place my king on B7 Magnus was unhappy with his Knight on F3 it was doing nothing much here so brings it to D2 also wants to exchange it on e4 so that this strong hold of black pieces is broken Rook comes to E8 Rook H E8 on the board and now Magnus takes on B5 let's see what karthikan plays here uh I think he must take with the pawn if he takes here then Bishop C4 is just game over so ab5 played if you give a check here then King B7 is a very good Square for the king so no problems there uh you know Black's King's weakness is kind of offset by his centrally positioned pieces they are so beautifully coordinating now Knight E4 is a good move because in a way what Magnus is saying is that your pieces are a bit weak so I'm trying to exchange it queen king B7 played perhaps not the best move but humanly very logical and Magnus now finds a very interesting move Queen F3 the threat is Knight takes Knight and then attacking this pinning it to the king so kikian plays his Queen to C6 very cool and now a good way to continue is to take take and take the pawn no but Magnus goes Bishop at six and this is a blunder what he's hoping for is that after take take take he would be better but what he has missed completely is that Rook takes E4 is possible and karthikan finds it brilliant move Rook takes E4 and you can see Hikaru there in the background looking at the board Rook takes E4 is just a massive blunder because after Rook takes E4 which is forced now you can take the bishop on H6 which is exactly what karakan has done and his position is winning because now he has two pieces for the rook and these two knights are very solidly placed a massive error by Magnus rookie one he just simply missed that black could make that intermediate Rook takes E4 happen he goes Rook E1 and now kikan what is his move here he goes King B8 fantastic move because the threat was Rook C1 and then picking up this Knight so King B8 is such a cool move because now the queen can settle down on B7 when it's attacked Rook e 2 played by Magnus when you make moves like Rook e one and rookie 2 you know that it's no longer that great a position Magnus is hoping that Bishop takes Pawn happens when he can get his Rook to the center but kakan is doing none of that he goes Queen to B7 it's a choice between now yeah he takes on D5 Knight takes D5 kikian down to a minute on the clock has been making so many good moves Queen takes F7 has been played and now this could become a weakness on H6 and these pawns could become very strong but the the move here that black should play C6 and Kian plays it cuz if Queen G6 there's Knight F4 and that is a big problem and if you bring your queen uh back then black can just coordinate Queen G7 Rook f8 so he takes the queen king takes and you can see that displeasure on magnus's face we are on move 29 kikan has 1 minute 47 seconds Magnus has 6 minutes but time has become less relevant here for the simple reason that Black's position is now way easier to play he brings this King to the center of the board and now Magnus can go in and attack this Pawn on H6 with Rook E6 he does so but kikan should not get passive Rook h8 means a passive move Rook f8 what a beautiful move if you take your knight E3 check and you win the rook and then if you move your king away or The Rook away then Rook comes to F6 and I trade the Rooks Rook D2 played and now that's how kikan will fight for an advantage with Rook to F6 so you see that he's not made his Rook passive at all if you trade the Rooks then with minor pieces black king comes in the pawn is weak and so Magnus Keeps The Rook he plays his Rook to E4 how should black make progress is the question here yes he's better but still beating mag Magus from a better position is never easy King D7 played one idea could be Rook E2 trying to then enter the position he goes G3 and this is not at all a good move because now kikan can actually go Rook to F5 and attack this Pawn on H5 he plays it and uh you can see Magnus shaking his head he has to go G4 but with this move he weakens the F4 s where where the Knight can jump in so now the Rook can move back exactly Rook goes back he saved everything Magnus Carlson is in big big trouble here and even the time pressure that karthikan has is not really helping him at all Rook comes here and again setting up an small trap if you go here Rook F3 and white wins so clearly you don't move your knight to that square you move your knight behind fantastic you are now going Knight E6 attacking here putting your knight on this amazing squares so Rook E3 played by Magnus maybe he wants to trade here get into this and try to attack and karthikan goes Knight E6 and his point is that now this Pawn is hanging but with this move Rook E3 Magnus had prepared a special move here uh this is move number 38 we have still not reached move 40 so he plays D5 and his point is if you take the Rook I take the Knight with a check King takes and Rook takes when the position is drawn so karthikan has to keep that patience here he takes the pawn Rook F3 important move you can't take here because your Rook is hanging so that's why first he plays Rook F3 and now you instead of trading you can go Rook G7 again so accurate so accurate now the G4 Pawn is hanging and also the Knight is ready to jump into D4 plays Rook D5 attacking the pawn on B5 and uh Rook takes the pawn so slowly and steadily black is coordinating and I love how confidently kikan is converting this we've reached move 40 Magnus goes and has a small bite something to eat after such a long fight and now Rook F6 he comes in to attack the pawn on H6 Bishop D4 fantastic move and one of the ideas of this move is of course to attack the B2 Pawn but if you take here which Magnus would most likely do then you have this excellent move which I'm sure karthikan has seen it he's very good at such things trapping the pieces Rook F4 it's not just attacking here but King C6 is going to trap The Rook notice how The Rook does not have any squares left so he takes the pawn and lets uh karthikan take the pawn on F2 this position should be drawish in nature if it were not for the fact that magnus's King is actually getting checkmated here King E1 and you can see that a rook and a pawn for two pieces is what the material balance is this is completely fine but Knight C5 and now the problem is there's a check coming in this Pawn is hanging and with the bishop moving in it's these three pieces are actually launching a mating attack on the white king king D1 and now Bishop Bishop E3 seems like a fantastic move yeah EXA exactly The Rook is hanging and if the Rook moves let's say Rook H7 I go King C6 and then if you save The Rook let's say Rook B8 I go Knight D3 with a forced mate here there's no way to stop this mate so that's the reason why Bishop E3 played and I think it's completely losing now karthikan also has 24 minutes he's walking around Magnus calls him and says I'm resigning the game and that is a victory for karti and the biggest one of his career previously he has beaten mvl and fuja in an immortal Queen sacrifice and there you can see Magnus saying I just missed Rook E4 I I just did not see Rook takes E4 and karik and of course uh analyzing with him what I would really like for you guys to do is check the analysis what they are saying it's not so easy to understand everything but look at how Magnus is analyzing even after losing the game game he's still very very much Keen to understand what's happening and towards the end he also congratulates kikan this is something that is an example in sportsmanship and a brilliant game played by karthikan a big congratulations to [Music] him make this I"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

opens the game with 1 C4 Hikaru the second seed of the tournament has been playing very steady chess he has had three wins and three draws four and a half out of six Barham had one loss in this tournament but has come back admirably C4 E6 play by Hikaru maybe he wants to go for the Queen's Gambit decline or who knows for the Dutch defense you never know with these players what they would go for Parham plays his Knight to C3 you can see from parham's finger on the left hand that he recently got married and the same is the case with Hikaru so two recently Weds facing off each other CD taken and now Hikaru takes back with the pawn as well Ed and the pawn moves to D4 so we have the ksb structure here but Hikaru instantly breaks with C5 going for a very active opening Knight comes out to F3 and now we are in kind of tarash territory here Knight F6 in fact it's the tarash so G3 is one way to play here which is the main line but param goes for the sharp line with Bishop G5 and Hikaru plays his Bishop out to E6 well there are some very sharp lines with E4 here let's see what param does he's played this before but he plays a move A3 which he has never played before and has only been tried in one game Pawn to C4 played by Hikaru after a long thing he's down to 1 Hour 4 minutes Barham takes on F6 also after quite some thought so they are both clearly out of their preparation and now Hikaru chops off the bishop with his Queen E4 seems seems like the most natural move to play here but what does peram do well he goes Queen A4 check very interesting Queen A4 check has been played in the position and the Knight comes to D7 now here Hikaru uh has played his Knight Pam can go forward and he pins it wa that's a nice move look at the pressure building up and the threat could be Knight takes pawn bishop takes and queen takes D7 Checkmate that's a big threat and Hikaru has to be careful here the game has sharpened up right from move number 10 Rook d8 fine move by Hikaru A7 Pawn is hanging but really that pawn does not matter so much here he goes E4 and here black has a very very amazing move he's hitting the center look at this move Bishop C5 if you take I take the Knight but Hikaru plays A6 and that is a mistake now and param has an advantage let's see if he manages to sort of push here firstly you can take the pawn on D5 and he does it e takes D5 is played so the bishop has to move so it goes to F5 and now this is a great move because if you play B5 I can take take and this is a very irritating pin with Castle coming up will param take the pawn on C4 at he's thinking oh he goes G4 well maybe the computer doesn't like it but what a sharp move this is just G4 hitting the bishop asking it where will it go and Hikaru pushes the pawn to B5 param simply comes back with his queen and the advantage is back in his hands because the queen is now better placed where will the bishop go oh he takes on E5 and his point is if you take here I want to take back and give you a check so G takes F5 played clearly you need to save your knight but if you go back it seems just too slow to play it that way so Hikaru calculating here down to 30 minutes on the clock peram has 36 minutes he gives a check on D3 well that Knight has to go param chops it off Pawn takes and now you just take that pawn with Queen takes D3 in the resulting position you will see that white is two pawns up although although his pawns are terribly doubled like these are doubled isolated pawns but they are still extra pawns and so really Hikaru has to be very careful he goes Bishop E7 and I think param now can play Rook G1 he can actually play Knight E4 he plays his Knight to E4 you can't take this Pawn there's a check and you lose the queen here so that you can't do you have to move the queen and where does Hikaru go he goes to B6 he plays his Queen to B6 and now what is the best move long Castle seems like a great move Rook C1 but he goes D6 param is like one strong move after another he's like now take this Pawn Hikaru well Hikaru takes it and what is the next blow on Pam's mind here oh he goes F6 and guys look at this if you play G6 I go Queen E3 and it's game over because if you Castle I go Queen at6 forc mate so this is H's very devilish plan but Hikaru finds Bishop E5 what a classy move he pins the pawn here and you can't take the bishop your queen is hanging and the bishop is threatening to take and also he's threatening to take on F6 so what does param do well he takes on G7 and he wants to make a queen so that pawn must be taken Bishop takes G7 has to be played and so he takes it Bishop G7 and now White Pawn is hanging here you need to save it he pushes forward but that opens up The Bishop's path to B2 will Hikaru take that pawn is it safe because when you take wward pawns your king which is in the center can get under under trouble but also White's King is in the center and right now param is a pawn up both of them playing such feury chess here although we've just played 22 moves the game has become so sharp and that's the reason why both of them are down to 20 minutes on the clock Hikaru there he's confused whether he should take or not because there are other possibilities as well you can move your queen over you can Castle well he takes it and it's the best move in the position and now Parham can bring his Rook into the center with Rook D1 or he can move his Rook to the corner with Rook a two and he plays Rook a 2 and his point is he wants to perhaps bring the Rook two to E2 and attack here and if the king castles then bring the other Rook to attack in that way all his pieces are working beautifully maybe it's prudent for Hikaru to go Queen D4 and exchange off the queens that seems like the best thing to do but he goes Bishop E5 oh can we go Rook E2 now well the problem is after Rook E2 either Queen D4 or King f8 just moving the queen away he goes Rook G1 he stops him from maybe at some Point castling well that is stopped for sure and I think Hikaru no matter how hard he wants to win here has to remain careful about his King he goes Queen D4 and that is a good move because now the queen trade cannot be avoided it has to be traded and on the other hand the D5 Pawn could become weak so peram is that end game worse for him well not really he takes Bishop takes and now where do you how do you save it he goes Rook E2 clearly taking this Pawn has its risk Knight F6 double check and you lose the Rook so that cannot be played what do you do here as black you play King D7 wow he's played his King forward and now where does param next activate his pieces for the time being his Pawn is safe but longterm black has the advantage because of these two pawns here against one and the B Bishop against the Knight but parham's pieces are very active and so Rook C8 played here is there some threat of a check here well anyway you can come out king D2 so it's not a big problem there param can continue with his attacking moves that he has been making and there you have it another active move Rook F5 attacking the pawn on F7 The Rook comes to f8 defending that pawn and uh maybe just Knight F6 check is that a possibility or do you go King D2 and start fighting your for yourself as well well param goes Knight F6 check and now Hikaru can avoid the trade with King D6 but he takes on F6 Rook takes on F6 and the a pawn is hanging and so now with 14 minutes on the clock for Hikaru 6 minutes for Parham A5 played and offers a draw and Parham instantly accepts it and 30 moves have been completed but what a fighting game of chess this was by both the players the Arbiter comes in very quickly and sees that what is the result of the game the kings are placed on the center of the board and they are analyzing param says let's go outside and analyze really the game was so sharp and complex in fact param did miss some chances there for himself Hikaru still in with a chance to win this tournament with five out of seven and param as always a pleasure to watch him play chess"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

Ne3 1-0", "output": "India Number One D gkes takes on David paravian in the round seven of the Qatar Masters 2023 David with the white pieces opens the game with one E4 and gkes what is the opening that he's going to play he can play E5 he can play C5 but today he's decided to go for the caroan with C6 D4 played by David and now gkes most likely going to play D5 the karukan is a very interesting opening uh and a very interesting choice by gukesh because he takes this game as sort of a game where he should push with the black pieces and that's why he's preferred to play the kokan over one E4 E5 or even the Sicilian so we have the classical variation on the board and there are two main moves here one is Bishop F5 but quickly gaining popularity is Knight F6 and the idea of this move is that when white takes which is the most common move to take with the E Pawn and although your Pawn structure is slightly compromised you have doubled pawns here uh it's compensated by the fact that you have free flowing development as you will see in the game gkes will place his Bishop on D6 Castle very quickly so he does that he puts his Bishop on D6 next up he's going to Castle it out Bishop comes to D3 and now black will castle and statically you are worse as black but dynamically gkes is looking for play with his pieces and this line Knight E2 is quite popular you put your knight on E2 and one of the main moves here is to go Rook to E8 just improving the position of your rook and making use of the open file that you've got because of taking the pawn here on F6 okay so GES already down to 1 hour 21 minutes his opponent blitzing out the moves H7 is attacked here you can play H6 but gukesh of course goes H5 and this is a well-known line here and David still in his prep goes short castles and how does gukesh continue here there are a few moves but H4 just makes a lot of sense because you are going to push in with H3 now one of White's main move here is H3 but you will see that David is very well prepared and he goes Bishop F4 and here a tactic like Bishop takes Queen takes Bishop takes F4 does not work because of Queen E4 and a double attack here so that's the reason why gkes goes Knight to A6 and and it's amazing that David is still in his preparation he has 1 hour 31 minutes while gkes is down to 1 hour 13 minutes and he's playing a line that is not too popular here for white I mean it's not been played before gukesh goes H3 and if David now blitzes out his moves that would be insane well he took 10 minutes for this move rookie one but his understanding of the position is so so good because he is ready to have his Pawn structure compromised Bishop f8 played and now what do you do here he plays his Knight to G3 and he's hoping that his opponent takes the pawn on G2 because then you can start pushing your H Pawn down the board which could be a very interesting idea well Bishop E6 was the best move here played by gkes and now with 57 minutes on the clock David has 1 hour 5 minutes G takes H3 played now visually for us humans this move doesn't look the best but computer likes it a lot and it says that here White's Advantage lies in the fact that his pieces are very well huddled together Rook E3 is such a good move you see Black's Knight is not doing much his Bishop is okay meanwhile this bishop is well placed okay gkes takes back the pawn but now you can avoid the trade of Rooks here by playing the Knight to E4 and that is exactly what David has done he's brought his Knight in the center he's now looking at this bishop just in case there are threats of Knight takes F6 followed by Rook check so gukesh goes Bishop to F5 putting pressure on the Knight and now a very logical move is to bring the last piece into the game Rook ae1 and here gukesh has to find what is the way in which he will continue he goes Bishop G6 which is a good move White's best try now is to play H4 maybe then Queen E2 with the idea of H5 but David now plays this move Rook G3 which is not a good move because the Rook is slightly misplaced here and you can simply take take and then play the move Knight C7 and black is doing fine in this position so GES must take here he has 23 minutes on the clock but he blunders with Queen D5 and that is a massive blunder look at David's time he has 36 minutes can he find the winning blow here it's not easy it's a slightly long-term positional sacrifice but it also leads to a huge attack and you can you can see there paravian thinking the move that we are looking at is Rook takes G6 and you might wonder why is that such a good move the reason is the light squares become tremendously weak and he takes it Rook takes G6 is on the board gukesh now takes the rook and the problem for black is very long-term this diagonal is weak and The Rook will move and attack and this is weak so this is Rook E3 what a nice move and I really love how David paravian took 10 minutes and has put gkes in a big big mess here rookie 7 and this position is just terrible for gkes you can see him under pressure and although a knockout blow is not in sight it will come Queen E2 is a nice little move the threat is Bishop C4 and that's the reason why gkes plays B5 to stop that move but now you can go Bishop C2 and bring the Bishop from here but he goes A4 which is also a decent move White's moves are actually quite easy to play Knight C7 played by gkes and he takes on B5 see B5 and the the issue that we've spoken about is that this is such a weak King and it's long-term weak so Bishop takes C7 he he's taken this more pieces that come off from the board is good for gkes but what is left on the board is really good for white now Bishop B5 played he's won a pawn next up Knight is coming to C5 to stop the action of this rook and then Bishop C4 Rook B8 played and now will David paravian go Knight C5 he plays his Bishop to D3 and this just a useful move to play Rook C8 played 10 minutes 59 seconds for David just 3 minutes left for gkes and they still have to make 13 moves Bishop A6 attacks The Rook maybe you know GES would be very happy if he can get this bishop for a rook but then he would be a pawn down and that would be not the best because these Pawns in the center are extremely strong so Rook d8 played and now white can go Knight to D2 ooh that's a cool move because now how do you stop Bishop C4 because Rook C8 is not possible so gukesh goes back and is point is that when you go Bishop C4 I can take the bishop but I can also go Rook D5 so Bishop C4 played by David paravian very nice play actually he's done it so well this conversion of the position Rook D5 played by gukesh and now do you take the Rook instantly no he goes Bishop B3 just improving the position subtly maybe wants to go C4 C5 goes Rook B7 and now he picks up the Rook Queen takes on D5 and now you can just trade off the queen with Queen to C4 and after take Knight takes the Knight also defends the pawn on B2 and that's exactly what he has done Queen C4 for the end game gkes is not just a pawn down but he also has the remaining pawns has doubled here which means that there's no way to create a quick passer and so let's just go through the moves they play um few moves and I think the main thing is that David slowly started to expand the position and brings his Knight back and C5 G3 takes Bishop G3 and now brings his Knight into the center the Knight is coming forward the pawns are moving ahead this is just a terrible position for gkes and you can see him on his face he knows that he's not played well today in fact his opponent did not give him a single chance that's how well David paravian played handshake there gukesh has lost his game and with this he's actually come down to 2740 from 2758 in these two tournaments that he has played in Asian Games and Grand swiss but well he will fight back and that is for sure he's a fighter two more rounds to go"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary

as a mark of respect he stands up and shakes his hands what an amazing gesture there he's 64 years old a legend in US chess an amazing chess coach and in this tournament he's played phenomenally well he beat yordan van forest in the last round and is right now on 5 out of seven the game has begun Magnus opens with 1 D4 and kaidanov plays his Pawn to D5 what an exciting battle we have on our hands let's see how this pans out Magnus takes his time and then goes for the London system well when kaidanov was in his prime that was roughly in the early 2000 and he was rated about 2600 the London system wasn't considered as potent a weapon as it is now let's see if he manages to neutralize magnus's London E3 played and now how does black continue Knight C6 is one idea Knight F6 is another and he's taking his time trying to figure out and see what he can do so he goes Knight to C6 here and Magnus is ready with his response play C3 so the London system is very simple you build a triangle here you put your Bishop outside the pawn chain you bring your knight to F3 your other Knight to D2 and you play your Bishop to D3 this is the general way in which London system players play and kaido says I don't see what uh White is doing I'm just simply going to develop all my pieces and I'll bring my Bishop out if needed he goes first Knight D2 now here the question does remain that should you play E6 which kaido has done or do you want to go Bishop F5 it's a more ambitious way to play but then uh White can go and start hassling this Pawn so kaido goes solid Magnus brings his Knight out to F3 and now a very concrete way to deal with the London and he takes on D4 so generally you avoid this exchange because white can improve his structure by taking this pawn and then getting a semiopen e file however the point is not that from here you're going to play normally as black you're going to play very concretely with Knight H5 so this is the move uh that kaidanov has prepared he's attacking the bishop if the bishop goes to G5 he wants to to kick it away with F6 so Magnus goes Bishop E3 of course he's well prepared for this line but now you go Bishop D6 preparing Knight F4 if white goes G3 trying to prevent it then the bishop then the Knight can come back but Magnus says I'm okay with you coming to F4 and he puts his Bishop on D3 the Knight jumps to F4 and the Knight had to be taken so now black can also take back and we reach a position where black has the bishop pair but look at the white pieces so beautifully positioned and the bishop is also nicely looking on this long diagonal White NOW castles and kaidanov also can simply Castle it out here uh that seems like the most logical thing to do there are other options as well you can drop your Bishop back yeah he castles that's that's fine and how should white continue now is the question I think a very useful move is Rook e one exactly Magnus does just that he puts his Rook on E1 The Rook is going to be useful on this semiopen file Bishop D7 completing the development here and later on you could try to play Queen C7 connect the Rooks and now Knight B3 Magnus plays this with 1 hour 28 minutes on the clock this has been played rarely before the idea is to go to C5 so he provokes B6 and now you will see what magnus's plan is Queen E2 and later he will hit this with A4 A5 so the B6 Pawn has been provoked there G6 played by kaidanov and this move uh in general is a useful move maybe the bishop can make its way back here A4 played by Magnus and a very useful move here he is trying to hassle the queen side with A5 F6 played wow so if black can get E5 break he would be very very happy in this position but it's not so easy and Magnus instantly goes Bishop B5 his idea is to take take and chop off this Pawn on E6 so kaidanov has to be careful here uh he goes Queen C7 good move by Gregory there he ALS also is now making way for The Rook to come to E8 defending the pawn and also promoting the idea of E5 break so Black's position looks completely fine and Magnus goes A5 so here if you were to take Knight A5 then after Knight A5 there's a lot of play happening on the queen side so kaido ignores it and brings his Rook to E8 you can see there Magnus now focusing he has played the opening very quickly just taking roughly 4 minutes for his last few moves and now for this move itself he took 12 minutes because this is the moment when you want to really uh Focus yourself Bishop H6 played by uh kaidanov a takes B6 and now how does Gregory respond he also takes back now this bishop going to H6 was an important moment because you could have also gone back to D6 there that was feasible how does Magnus continue now is the question where is your play coming from here and Magnus answers this question with the move C4 a good idea here is to ignore this just play King h8 come out of this diagonal if you go King h8 Pawn takes Pawn takes this is very good for black but kaidanov decides here to take on C 4 and he tells Magnus that I don't think that your position is so good yes my E6 Pawn is weak but so is your D4 Pawn so Magnus now goes and chops off the pawn he also pins the Knight here and queen D6 played I I really feel king h8 would have been a much more useful move but Queen D6 is coming out of the pin Magnus goes Rook A6 fantastic move he's attacking this pawn and it's hanging you need to defend it in some way Rook B8 played by kaidanov here and if given some time he would like to maybe put this Rook here maybe exchange the Queens with Queen D5 but Magnus goes Knight C5 what a move there if you take the Knight I take back I hit your queen and if you go back I take take and these are the tactics in the air so kaido finds a beautiful move Knight D4 four and you can see there Magnus also takes back but this is the point that Gregory has actually seen it here he can now take Queen takes C5 fantastic chess so if Bishop D7 takes takes takes takes then there's Rook E8 maybe you have to take care with the Rook but it's not a huge Advantage for white so black should be fine there Magnus can indulge in these tactical bouts but they are not really giving him an advantage so he goes Rook A7 nice move there now very important to play this Rook to d8 the reason for that is that later on this Rook can come here in many lines when F7 is hanging so I mean to come to F7 and he finds it this was really tough this was really tough this Rook was not a good move he finds Rook B d8 fantastic Chess By kaidanov B4 played by Magnus he's forcing his opponent to take a call here and now you must take the queen that seems like the appropriate solution yes he takes Queen takes Bishop takes C4 and now black must go B5 fighting for the space and then he's doing very well but he goes Rook E8 and this is the mistake that Magnus was waiting for kaido is down to 16 minutes Magnus now push PES the pawn and this is the point even though white is a pawn down his Rook is active this Pawn is weak this Rook is active and now the Knight gets this beautiful Square on C6 so Gregory goes back Bishop C8 but now Knight to C6 and Magnus not going to cash in easily you know this a move like Bishop E6 and stuff he's not going to play there he is going to calmly go Knight C6 and build up the pressure because now if you go Rook D7 trying to fight here Rook takes E6 is a kaboom move so Rook D6 has to be played and now this Pawn is defended Magnus can still press how does he press here he goes Rook C7 and his idea is to bring the other Rook this way complete bind on the position black pieces are very passive and for kaido maybe King h8 is an important move no he goes Bishop D7 but now it's time for Magnus to bring his other Rook into the game we can see Hikaru in the background there and Magnus brings his Rook to A1 The Rook is coming to A7 on the seventh rank how should black continue here it's unclear it's unclear and kaidanov is in big trouble time wise as well he has just 5 minutes left on the clock he goes Bishop Bishop f8 Magnus on the other hand has 58 minutes on the clock here The Rook moves into the seventh now the bishop is hanging both the Rooks are doubled up it looks like the game is coming to an end but Bishop takes C6 kaidanov keeps fighting he takes Magnus takes with the pawn the pawn is just two steps away from queening but notice that there are opposite colored Bishops on the board and there could be some hopes to fight for a draw here so check first and now the King has to come up on G2 Magnus taking his time he's maybe even considering a move like Bishop F1 as a possibility but I mean logical is to just go King G2 the reason why you would even consider Bishop F1 is because now Rook C1 would attack the bishop and also Place The Rook behind the pawn yes Rook C1 played and now Bishop a bishop B5 or Bishop A6 might be the best moves in the position but it's not so easy like if you go Bishop A6 Bishop D6 uh there is Rook G7 followed by maybe C7 coming up at the right Point um but Magnus goes Rook A4 he brings his Rook back defends the bishop B5 played by kaido fantastic move here Bishop takes B5 and now he can actually go and attack here Rook C5 so magnus's coordination is broken the material is still even yes the C Pawn is strong but it might fall now Rook B4 is important to defend this no but he goes Bishop C4 and here black had a great move which is F5 and why is this great because next when you play take let's say for example I go Bishop B3 take take take take and you go um take King G7 and Rook A7 then King F6 is possible but F5 was such a tough move to find and so he goes Bishop D6 but now Magnus goes Rook B7 and very important move because now if you take there is Bishop B5 winning the game so he cannot really take he goes King h8 but you know this bishop is a gymnast it is going to do many acrobatic stuff on the board and one of them is to chop this Pawn if you take the bishop Rook A8 is a Checkmate happening and if you take this Pawn then Bishop D7 just sort of hits both the Rooks so Rook E7 played but now Magnus is winning this game with Rook takes on E7 Bishop takes on E7 yes uh take Bishop takes on E7 and now comes a nice check here on A8 King has to come up King G7 we have reached move 40 uh but the position is lost Rook A7 attacks here if you go King f8 then C7 C8 is coming so he takes the pawn on C6 but now Magnus takes the bishop the only hope is if King f8 The Rook has to move and you can move you can take this bishop but Magnus has seen it through how how to win here he goes Rook F7 check and I think it's time to call it a day F6 is falling and Magnus has won the game a very very interesting battle shake off hands there fantastically played by the world number one Magnus cson but really great fight by kaidanov and there Magnus says you should have gone B5 uh there instead of allowing B5 in that position which we just saw and then you play Rook E8 is what he's saying uh that would really give this uh great space in the position yeah away sit just because take care because I out"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the

ambassador of India in katar we will to master K against I wish you all a very good day you us for for for for for for for e for for for for for for e for [Music] sh [Music] good that must been amazing I'm joined by Grandmaster abhimanu and Grand Master Anish and they played a crazy game so abanu if you can take us through the game and also your queen sacrifice yeah so I was thinking what to do against Nash off like yesterday and I was working around soen a bit a few days ago and I thought this idea is quite interesting at least it's not so easy for black to find stuff over there practically and uh against after B4 and C2 uh like here the most natural move is uh Bishop B Sun but this is probably uh not that easy practically for black I thought but uh instead what he played Knight of D so when I was checking like I thought okay Knight of D it looks ridiculous yeah just bringing a knight back for no reason but it is the best move and I couldn't remember the details but like what if I play like Knight F4 or anything but I remember that I'm worse if I continue so the only way to draw is like give this queen sacrifice with Queen F7 96 and looks very weird but it sort of works like a pendulum and it's a draw right uh coming to Anish when he made that sacrifice there were a lot of people around your board and uh we could we had a delayed uh broadcast but we could see your reaction if you can tell us what was going through your mind yeah I think there are two types of people there's a small group of people who had seen this position before um and there's a large group of people who have never seen that before I think both groups were quite amused by today's game uh of course it looks very spectacular actually the reason I know this line is uh so of course I did my n course and then uh Adan played um game against abanu Mishra in Rapid he won a very spectacular game with Queen F3 and I think my course was fresh at the time so I had to of course update yeah because I have to do an update so I looked at that uh line and uh I was actually very excited about the line first because I knew this bishop B7 which is also what Manu played I think and also the top engine move because computer says black is back in the day at least it said that black is better at first I think now probably still weak engine will say black is better because computer doesn't see all kinds of potential sacrifices you know that are typical for this line and uh I was inputting the moves when I saw the computer you know going back to equality with kinds of insane lines and I was like wow this is so amazing what I one played I'm going to play it as well and then I saw this second option computer said also Knight fd7 and I so wow queex F7 is equal zero triple Z I was like unbelievable you can sacrifice a queen for Just Two pawns and be equal I was like oh this is the best Best Line I've ever seen and then I put the moves 96 and I see the whole point is just to repeat moves 97 96 there is no of course you you're down the queen for Just Two Pawns of course you can do nothing I mean if you take my Rook you're are just Queen for a rook it's nothing you need the rook and the pce and like I don't know what more so the whole point of and then I was like you know like okay this line is not as great as it looks I mean this just forc to draw and um yeah I didn't uh I didn't prepare this for this game at all because uh I've never played this bishop C4 before of course I knew he will try surprise me because it's what people do against my n um so it's what you what you sign up for when you decide to sell merchandise instead of play chess but um no I was uh trying to you know I was um trying to predict him and I went really deep into his into his mind you know I looked all his just binda videos I um I saw all his online games I tried to see you know get into his head what kind of thoughts he will have I thought about all kinds of lines but somehow this one eluded me me and when he play Bishop C4 I realized that it's actually interesting choice and then when he played Queen F3 which I really didn't expect that's when I remember that oh yes this of course there's also this line Queen F3 um and the thing is that I remember that black maybe has options because okay this bishop B7 is not losing but unfortunately like because you know I usually I prepare this for like the top tournament where draw is like really good um against like when you play um closed event and you have white games black games and then everybody tries to win with white so uh I was kind of I remember this line uh and of course now in the open situation for both me and ab Manu like the tournament Is Not Great to make draw but I was just not really I didn't really know how to play and obviously he's prepared like I mean what is he preparing against if not for for Neer I mean I don't know if not then something's wrong with him so I realized that if I just I mean it's would be too sick a gamble to just make a move like Bishop B7 and say okay sacrifice me show what computer showed me and then what am I kind of hoping for um so yeah yeah of course I I mean I just did what I what I usually do when I played my my prep and yeah it's like too beautiful but unfortunately it's it's not one of those sacrifices where it's like positional and it continues sometimes it's kind of half positional it continues for like few moves if black makes few accurate moves it's going to be draw but here the point is that I just move the queen away and the whole idea is to make it so it's is the queen sack is not Queen sack is not a try at that point Queen sack is just not already like the try was before like if I know Knight fd7 then Queen sack is just to just force a draw uh there's really nothing more to it but it was very beautiful and uh many people were of course puzzled because it's only two points and but it's nice to see know the theor is um yeah it says all sorts of lines and at least the good thing about this particular game is that I think this has never been played before and so people will include it in their further chessable courses yes exactly exactly it will be included in the courses and uh because you know sometimes you have these lines in the N of um or some where you have like 20 draws that are all the same and they're like non Theory so okay at least here at least it's some kind of new thing but of course I think both of us tournament situation wise didn't want to make draw it's also nice line to like sometimes people you know they I never did but sometimes people they pre-arrange draws you know they agree beforehand that we'll make draw and some even go to the extreme they even plan exact game how they will play and then they make up a game like this beautiful that is like completely correct and draw uh but least people know that okay I mean it's first time I speak to AB Manu today I just don't don't know him I mean also for him as well I think it's not no point to make draw but it's just um yeah like the unfortunate part is that sort of I didn't prepare for this game uh otherwise I would have made up some other plan and he also of course I mean he has all the rights to hope that I don't know this because why would I know it so it's um it's not even in my course not in the main course at least it's in only in the update probably so it's uh I'm not sure if in the update I gave native the seven I'm might have kept it for uh for myself such easy draw maybe I gave some other solution for the update I don't remember but um yeah it's it's not like he wanted to make he just sort of wanted to to play and I thought this is a good chance uh okay if draw is draw is fine and I also of course would have liked to to play but okay I'm not crazy yeah I mean I like to play chess but uh I have my limits to how I want to play chess on my terms not on my opponent's terms uh and I want to play with abanu not with his computer yeah makesense right uh it is not every day that we do a Duo interview of somebody who has just played but it is very admirable for you Anish to to see that you were discussing the entire game with abim Manu for a long time so Abu what is your takea away from the game and also the analysis yeah like like I just realized that no matter like you know I was when I was preparing this yeah like I really thought Knight of d looks ridiculous yeah people don't play Such moves but obviously like he had checked Ed before like I should have in hset tried to predict it but on the other hand ndof is a very weird opening and I have played so many games where I tried very hard to surprise my opponent and it just went horribly wrong so I was trying to find the balance between both so I guess I should just do the same thing but a bit better probably next time great uh Anish one final question tomorrow is the final round and we have seen all sorts of results in this tournament very strange some very optimistic results what what is her prepar and how are you going to prepare yourself to come tomorrow yeah I think um probably the tourament standing will um uh make me and my opponent uh you know have to play for a win tomorrow because uh already clearly I'm behind the the leaders and probably so will be my opponent although not 100% sure because I could be paired up uh but anyway we'll see um yeah I'm as I'm already mentioned before like I think tournament is not going great for me like you know when I was before the event I always thought like I no expect versus real okay I'll come probably some newbies okay I mean I you know and then I'll probably win my first four games I guess then I'll probably play Magnus maybe I'll draw then I'll play probably GES maybe I'll also draw maybe then I'll probably play you know then I will play another newbie then I'll probably beat him then I'll play Hikaru probably also draw him or or maybe lose doesn't matter but still I'll be there you know like and like this was like expectation versus and then I come here like Magnus is down like injured my body is one body my one man down already gu is injured after like round two then uh uh myself I'm like start to Falling you know Hikaru is like gradually bleeding his uh his points away GES you know already wants to kill someone in the corner I see him in his eyes you know he's just ready to to just murder someone it's completely Furious and like it's not nothing nothing like you would think before uh so yeah my tournament is like is not great cuz I have losing rating and so on so far I think I'm performing like a decent 2600 player like decent which is quite something as well uh I think it's challenge nowadays knows it's to 2600 is difficult but uh yeah it's uh yeah it's difficult for many people and um it's not the worst and depends on to how tomorrow goes um yeah I don't you know I'm not like uh don't have many reason to be like super optimistic but you have to try and do your best then sometimes you get lucky you know so hope for that right same question to you a great result today would you consider this as your best one of your best results I mean uh it is I would say it's a mixed feeling I don't know like because before the game what I really wanted okay I didn't care about what the result is going to be I just wanted some to do something wild but uh I mean it's a fine result but like you said now like there's STW pressure tomorrow so because to be in the prizes I have to play for a win with black which is obviously not going to be easy uh yeah actually my roommate karti won against Magnus yesterday so we had quite a party atmosphere in my room and then I understood him playing him so we had quite a quite an interesting moment very strong room it's crazy yeah and okay I mean I'm sure like uh I think he has beaten me in the world Blitz Championship so I think to to say today's a big achievement for him is uh is you know to downplay his his chess career as well like I think I think he yeah he's capable of more as well so um but uh yeah wow I mean if I knew that you share room with I would I would have treated the whole thing very differently I didn't have that information actually I was kind of curious but the thing is I wanted to be fair I of course have a lot of Indian friends who are I'm really on good terms and I could ask them like you know Manu guy who is he like working because sometimes I know the there are camps of people like you know there this guy works with that guy so I could ask but I didn't want to put my friends in uncomfortable spot maybe they're also friends with you and I didn't want to be nasty I didn't want to use any inside information so I was like okay I'll just you know look at his games and just don't use any inside knowledge but for example yeah not knowing that he's sharing a room with K after yesterday this is this is a big blow I mean had I known that the game would have been completely different I would have realized of course he would play something crazy I immediately check Bishop C4 neither the first thing to check uh I imagine this scans dancing around you like singing there like all sorts of uh Indian sweets flying around the room I can not that happening we just went to the Instagram I saw your Instagram I know you you check that much yeah no but I know the dancing no I know your dancing skills I mean your dancing SKS very impressive uh this very good Instagram video by the way people are just recommend um man was dancing with um I think there was one Arjun video with Arjun with Arjun yes yes yes yes that's really good stuff like really good so I knew quite a bit but yeah not knowing the she shares the room with kikan that's that was that was a blow but we have an inside information that Anish not only prepares uh games but also Instagram handles of the players you have to be careful next time we have to I think just I start I start every so I get paired I go just B inia Channel I verif make sure I subscribed just to be sure and then I and the bell also and then I typed my opponent's name in there and then I start watching all the interviews by the time I'm done with I have 1 hour left before the game then I type in the you know in the chess base what opening they play and then I'm good to go that's how I usually do it thank you so much you guys a great game we enjoyed it from outside and uh wish the best for you for tomorrow's round and also for the upcoming tournaments thank you thank you"}, {"instruction":

GM Robbie kevi gkes has the white pieces comes well dressed in his jacket opens the game with 1 D4 what is gk's opening going to be very interesting to see Robbie goes Knight F6 and gkes brings his Bishop out we have the London system on the board that's going to be exciting top players these days whenever they want to fight for the full point are going in for the London because it leads to some kind of uh new games new setups maybe the opponents are not so well prepared yet E6 played here by Robbie and now gkes pushes his Pawn to E3 black has many way ways to play here one is D5 other one is C5 he plays his Pawn to C5 and will'll be interesting to see how gukesh responds to this C3 is one move here and also you can bring your knight out to F3 that's what gkes does he brings his Knight to F3 London system fans can learn a lot from this way in which gkes is playing here Bishop E7 played by Robbie and one of the main lines here is to go B6 bb7 castles and so on anat kpov used to play that way but H4 now played by gkes the modern treatment of the opening you don't really care where your king is going to go you just push your hedge Pawn Robbie goes B6 and this is also an interesting way to continue but when B6 is played white can now take advantage of it you can see gkes now plays his Knight to C3 this is an excellent move because if I mean Bishop B7 already Knight B5 can become very tricky to handle so this move B6 is a little bit dangerous now Robbie takes CX D4 and here e Tak D4 is possible but white here can also take with the Knight and gkes takes Knight takes on D4 has been played fantastic Castle's played the the main point of Knight takes D4 is that now the Knight can jump here in instead if you had played A6 then Queen F3 would have hit the rook and you can't even move the Rook because the Knight is hanging so anyway castles Knight B5 the Knight jumps back and gkes goes Queen F3 attacking The Rook you can see that it's Moon number nine but already the game has become so sharp Robbie plays his Knight to C6 and gukesh can now jump into D6 at the right moment but first he needs one more support and for that long castling seems like the solution here gukesh taking his time and he plays long Castle aggressively playing this game also he has a Pawn on H4 soon his other Pawn can join in and launch a huge attack Bishop B7 played by Robbie one would think that Robbie would be imagining that he has made no real mistakes out of the opening so he shouldn't be really worse here but you can also argue that the move B6 was inaccurate now GES wants to push his Pawn to H6 and sort of soften up Black's King side A6 has been played and he goes in with his Knight Knight comes to D6 and after takes on D6 but can take back with the bishop yes he takes Bishop takes on D6 and after Bishop takes D6 there will be Rook takes D6 which will happen but he plays F5 wo interesting move white has no real control in the center with his pawns but what he has is somehow his pieces are coordinating beautifully The Rook is well placed the queen is in the game looking Here pawn coming forward B5 played by Robbie and now how does gkes continue here the game this is very instructive he first takes on E7 notice okay how gukesh manages to create counterplay because this is something for all of us to learn Queen takes E7 and and now you might think oh he might develop his Bishop here looks good uh but first queen C7 attacks the bishop and he's like okay if you play D5 I'll trade and this might be a slightly better end game for me so playing D5 doesn't really uh is not very attractive so Bishop C8 makes sense because you can always kick the queen away with Rook A7 but now comes gk's nice little move G4 and that's how you create play you are hacking this structure and then your Bishop can go on and put even more pressure B4 played by kevish the Knight has to move where will the Knight go is the question gkes decides to go to A4 later the Knight can jump to C5 or B6 and that's why the Knight is well placed there and now he takes the pawn he's he's won a pawn and also if you see he's attacking the F2 Pawn so gukesh needs to play carefully he comes back Queen G3 and defends the pawn and also prepares to take this so now the plans are clear the bishop can go to D3 or C4 Rook can come to G1 he goes D5 so okay Bishop can't go here but we can put our Bishop on D3 but instead gukesh goes on E2 he wants to take this Pawn with his bishop and with that he also wants to put pressure on E6 Rook B8 played now Rook comes here careful your Rook could be hanging if the Knight moves away so gkes now brings The Rook to G1 that's a new life for The Rook he's looking at the G7 Pawn wow this is very exciting Bishop D7 played by Robbie and now white can play Bishop takes G4 so takes and notice now Bishop takes E6 will already unleash some pressure here however the queen is defending so you can actually deflect the queen with Knight C5 ideas King h8 is a decent move here by Robbie and I think gkes uh also goes King B1 so that his King is safe and black can do well to play H6 the game is still evenly poised but a big mistake here by Robbie Knight A7 and this Knight was very important to control the E5 Square the moment it has moved gukesh now plays Knight to C5 fantastic move played by gukesh and the point is the Knight is attacking A6 D7 and E6 all these pawns so what's happening Robbie says I'm just taking the Knight but gukesh now has another powerful strike in the position can you find it white to play gkes Thinking hard here but he's already figured it out I'm sure he knows what his next moves going to be he takes on E6 and he's threatening a mate here and uh there's no real way you go Queen E7 that's the most logical move because now the queen defends the bishop also the pawn and this next move is an absolute joy to watch H6 because if you take on E6 I take the pawn with a check and I win your rook and your Rook can't even go here because this is hanging so he goes gh6 in fact G6 was the best defense here but gh6 is played and that is the last and final blunder gkes goes Queen E5 check and I think Robbie has missed something if Rook F6 then the B8 Rook is hanging and he goes Queen F6 hoping that after Queen takes Rook takes Bishop D7 but GES goes Rook G8 check and there you can see Robbie had missed this move a deflection Rook takes Rook is forced you lose the queen and it's game over in just 28 moves gukesh has managed to create quite a nice miniature and a fantastic attack in the London system that's what this youngster does when he's in full flow he can really really play aggressive creative and beautiful chess"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the

BRZ and also Hikaru knows him by that and now even Magnus calls him that after the European Club cup Knight F6 played and prano is um a very famous internet player because he loves to play Blitz chess but also over the board he's slowly and steadily getting very strong his rating is right now close to 2600 and this is a big opportunity to him to fight against the world number three Hikaru Nakamura he plays E6 and now Hikaru must decide should he play Knight C3 and allow the nimzo Indian but he goes Knight F3 and generally prano doesn't go for lines with D5 he plays something more fighting he goes B6 and we saw this same opening being played in the game between Magnus Carlson and alisher sulov in the second round and that is exactly what Hikaru also plays what alisher went for A3 and now the bishop can come out to A6 attack the pawn on C4 how do you defend it you can play E3 you you can play Knight D2 but you can also play Queen C2 that is a simple move and the idea of Bishop A6 is to sort of divert the queen from the D file then come back and then hit the position with C5 when D5 is not possible so Hikaru goes Knight out to C3 and now black must play C5 otherwise there was no point of provoking the queen to the C2 Square so he plays C5 clear clearly D5 wouldn't be that great because you would lose the pawn um and so E4 is what suano also played against Magnus and this is now becoming quite uh fashionable it seems so E4 white gains space in the center and was threatening to push the pawn forward so prano takes it and I think Hikaru must also take back with his Knight he does so Knight takes D4 and now Bishop to C5 is a is a normal idea pushing the Knight away from the Central Square so he goes Bishop to C5 attacking the Knight the Knight now went to F3 in suan of game but I think Knight B3 is also possible here and you can see Hikaru thinking about what to do he goes Knight B3 both players are on 1 hour 32 minutes on the clock now there's no point in actually saving this bishop because you are looking at the dark Square so he goes Knight C6 and his point is that he wants to look at the D4 Square in the center you know the dark squares are slightly weakened so F3 played by Hikaru this is not the main move the main move is Bishop G5 there's also a lot of games with Bishop F4 but he plays F3 and now prano can save his Bishop go back to D6 it's possible but he goes castles which is also a fine move and Hikaru now still on 1 hour 32 minutes prano took 16 minutes for his last move which was castles and now Hikaru chops off the bishop it's uh quite amazing that Hikaru has prepared this line in great depth and even though he's not a full-time player he's a streamer but he still is able to come up with lot of fresh ideas which is uh quite amazing Bishop E3 played attacking the pawn on C5 now let's try to understand the position a little more closely after PR's next move D6 which is a good move you will see that white has the bishop pair and a strong Center but what black has is this D4 square and that is an important thing to have because at the right time if you can play E5 and blon your knight in the center it can be very valuable so after Bishop D3 a move that should be very clearly considered by prano is E5 or moving the Knight to D7 maybe then later to E5 playing on the dark squares but he goes Rook C8 and this move and the next move of prau does not seem very logical Rook C8 what is the point of having the Rook there yes maybe he wanted to go Knight D4 and then use the Rook here Hikaru castles but you know after Knight D4 now you never really take the Knight you just move your queen away and then B4 is coming so Rook on C doesn't do much and now prano thinks for a bit more 20 minutes in fact and plays Rook E8 another move which really uh is quite curious maybe he wanted to play D5 somewhere I I I don't know and then if things open up then he's attacking The Rook but Hikaru kind of ignores it plays Rooks plays his Rook to D1 and The Rook is now well positioned opposite the queen and as we mentioned going into the center with the Knight just Queen F2 so Queen E7 played here and how is Hikaru going to continue he goes Queen F2 fantastic move here and he is looking at this square and if you play E5 here then I have Knight D5 take take Knight D4 and this very powerful move B4 so this is what is creating prano from not going E5 he goes Knight E5 now look at the way in which prano creates play this is his strong point first he wants to take a bishop and Hikaru says sorry I can't give you he goes back Bishop E2 good move and for pranav now uh the point is Hikaru might very soon start to kick him away with the move F4 but for the time being he's created another attack on the C4 Pawn with his Knight and the bishop so B3 played by Hikaru good move defends it if you attack the pawn here I will also defend it with my Rook no problems there and now comes Rook d8 so White's idea is to push the pawn to H3 now and play F4 because if he goes directly F4 the Knight jumps to the G4 Square so you can see Hikaru now really pushing prano back with all the space keeping the pieces intact and the structure intact he's going now for F4 maybe who knows in future even G4 so prano goes Knight C6 and this is where H I really love how Hikaru plays the time is 48 minutes for Hikaru 19 minutes for prano Hikaru takes a good long think here and plays B4 he's not against playing sharp chess that is what makes Hikaru so so po important now the point is this is a pawn sacrifice but after Pawn takes Pawn takes the Rook opens up and by the way prano takes it he must be bold he has 12 minutes on the clock and after Pawn takes which Hikaru most likely will play now the bishop is hanging so the Knight will take but you can feel it that everything is in the air if the Knight can be attacked then the bishop will fall on A6 so how do you protect everything here is the billion dollar question he goes Rook A4 nice move there by Hikaru the Knight cannot move and if you play Rook B8 then the A7 Pawn is hanging so he goes D5 defending the Knight with his Queen and you know Hikaru has already prepared his next move he calculates he's wiing there he goes Rook B1 and he says to prano that now your knight is hanging what's what's your plan but buddy prau as we know him is very very tricky he goes Knight C2 fantastic if you take the bishop Knight E3 Queen E3 and D4 you win back the piece and Knight C2 has another trick in fact Hikaru was going to fall for it almost he was going to play here the move uh he plays E5 this is a very good move because he was going to go Bishop A7 but then prano had prepared take take and Knight A3 which would have given him a nice position but E5 is a good move by Hikaru is attacking the Knight on F6 the Knight goes back to E8 now Hikaru down to 15 minutes because calculating all of this takes time prano has 12 minutes still on the clock and here he goes Bishop C1 that is fine because now the bishop is hanging and you can't move the bishop away if you move it here A7 Falls so that's the reason why he goes D4 and he's attacking the Knight here and now the Knight has to move he goes Knight E4 good move there and pushing the pawn even further doesn't make sense because I take take and I take here and the A6 Bishop is also hanging so you can't push even further Rook C6 played to defend the Knight is precariously positioned on the C2 Square Bishop D3 would be a nice move here because after Knight E3 you have Queen A2 putting more pressure on the the a file but Hikaru goes for Bishop G5 prano quickly PS F6 and Bishop H4 but this position now prano is fighting back from a lost position he has complicated the game enough to bring Hikaru into not a very comfortable position now Knight E3 is the move you get your knight out from that yes he plays it and here actually the flow could completely be disrupted for Hikaru you can see there he's looking at his opponent as if something's gone wrong he ah he wants to go Rook A1 and the thing is how do you protect this bishop there too many problems F6 is also loose there are there's a lot of pressure here the bishop cannot move he he takes on C4 he takes here but I believe that now Hikaru has some deadly ideas in his mind 9 minutes 52 seconds for him to work out prano has 3 minutes only left e takes F6 played the queen is attacked and now prano takes it back so what is the way in which Hikaru should continue well first of all you have to take this Pawn on A7 that is the right way to continue so Hikaru trying to use his Queen side pieces to launch an attack on the king imagine a queen entering from here the Knight is well placed the bishop is well placed so Rook D7 a good move now you can actually take take and go into this position and play here but it's still not so clear prano is still fighting here so Hikaru is not so happy with that that simple line where he can win back his Pawn so he goes Rook A8 but this allows now of course his threat is to play Knight F6 check here and that would be crushing so King F7 is a good move and prano is like okay if you take here I'm ready to take with the queen if you take on F6 I'll move my queen it's still not over I'm fighting on but but this move is very nice look the bishop is opening up to give a check with a killer blow to the Knight so this bishop has to go and prano takes it which is the correct move Hikaru takes with the queen now the queen is threatening to come here but the right defense is King G7 it's such a tough move to find and the point is that after Queen H5 you have Queen F7 but prano doesn't find it he goes Rook D5 but Hikaru has a killer moon now Bishop G5 takes Queen H5 G7 and take here with a mating attack but it's so tough to find with Just 4 minutes on the clock so he comes back Bishop F2 and prano is once again back in the game his move again not so clear you can go Rook C7 you can also go Knight C7 there are few possibilities but prano here is thinking about moving the Knight he goes Knight C4 with Just 2 seconds on the clock and he blunders here and this is hikaru's chance he has 2 minutes to work it out this is Moon number 37 and then there you see Hikaru thinking what exactly has my opponent done and with 50 seconds on the clock he chops off the pawn on D4 the point is if you take here Queen H5 is killing it was a deflection once again a very nice move there by uh Hikaru Knight has to go back but now you've lost a very very crucial Pawn in this position the D4 Pawn which was a very important one Rook A7 played and Hikaru is just killing this now uh because if you go Rook C7 which is the most natural move then I have Bishop B6 or I can simply take and bring my other Rook he goes Knight B7 but now uh there is a tactical reputation to this Rook B7 played and um yeah you you you have to take with the queen and after Queen takes B7 you can see prano there he has missed something uh and Hikaru once again showing that he's so so powerful in such complicated positions when it comes to calculation Rook comes to A7 and this is game over because after Queen A7 Bishop A7 prano will be a complete piece down and it's time to resign the game you can see him there not so happy with the way he's played but he defended so resourcefully he was pushed to the wall right from the opening but he had almost brought the position back and there you have it he resigns Hikaru shakes hands he knows that he played well today but prano fought really well and let's hear what they are analyzing 10 seconds M you find6 nothing it's crazy after after 54 first I can I don't know I take"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following

this is going to be a very critical one Arjun has the white pieces let's see how he plays he plays his Pawn up to D4 what is the opening that Arjun prefers here because Arjun is a very tricky opening specialist uh in Rapid and Blitz Games but today in this classical game he has gone for C4 and David paravian just takes it he goes for the Queen's Gambit accepted variation so Arjun takes a bit of time and plays Knight to F3 you can take this Pawn after a while Knight comes out to F6 and now Arjun most likely will play E3 yes you you really can't uh cling onto the pawn because after C6 takes takes there's always B3 and you get back the pawn so E6 played Arjun chops off the pawn and now C5 with this black strikes the center so for black the ideas could revolve around bringing the Knight out the bishop out castling but always the tricky part is related to the bishop on C8 where will it come so A6 is played with that intention so that you can play B5 and Bishop B7 very quickly the downside of this strategy always is that you would lag behind in development and also Arjun plays his Knight to D2 not to C3 and now he takes Knight takes D4 very interesting Bishop C5 played by David and he has 1 hour 33 minutes which means he's very well prepared and I think his preparation was was also really up to the mark against gkes so he's a player that you really need to be careful about when you're preparing against him so Castle played Here and Now Arjun can just develop his Bishop that's what he's doing Bishop goes to B2 why Black's main problem is his uh pieces are not coming out so easily finally he plays B5 and if he can get Bishop B7 and Knight C6 he should become completely fine but Arjun goes Queen F3 and he hits The Rook which is slightly loose there and there are a few ways in which you can defend the most natural looks Rook A7 to save it but also you can go Queen B6 and when the queen takes here you can trap the queen so Rook A7 is played and now Arjun comes back with his Bishop so you can see that the two Bishops are now lining up on the king side and the queen can also move to H3 to attack so Arjun going aggressive Bishop B7 played and now by the way if you can play Queen H3 getting here the problem is E5 and then the bishop drops so you cannot do that he plays his Knight to E4 so Knight comes out to E4 and we have to see how this continues now Knight to D7 this is a pin and so you cannot take on C5 you would lose the queen you can take on F6 with a check but then he just takes back so black seems to have done pretty okay in the opening Knight takes F6 and I think you take back with the Knight for sure I'm not so sure how arjun's actually going to get an advantage out of the opening Knight takes maybe he's going to go Queen G3 because he has to play against E5 and he does it he plays his Queen to G3 one normal move now is Rook A8 so that you can bring your Rook back but he plays Queen D6 and you can see there he hesitates a bit because this is a blunder this is a mistake here and let's see if Arjun can spot it Arjun thinks for a bit takes on D6 Bishop takes on D6 six and now comes a very powerful move Bishop B5 yes Arjun has seen it he snatches that pawn and the point of it is that after a takes B5 Knight takes B5 there is a double attack here so a takes B5 played and now Arjun takes on B5 attacking the rook and the bishop very interesting play by Arjun arigi and now he has a clear advant Advantage because even if you try to save your Rook I can just attack it from here and then enter so that's the reason why he goes Rook A6 and the point now is revealed after Knight D6 Rook D6 in comes a wonderful skewer with Bishop A3 yes pretty move the Rook is attacked and the other Rook is also attacked here Rook comes to D2 and now you can pick up the Rook on f8 King f8 now in this position white is better for sure is he winning that's debatable um if Rooks are traded then yes white would win because the two pawns here would be too strong for the minor pieces so I love arjun's next move F3 because he blunts the bishop and he also stops the knight from coming forward and he's going to go Rook F2 next David plays a very good move he plays G5 because his point is to hassle the structure with G4 and Arjun builds the wall even stronger with E4 so now the bishop is really limited by these pawns but everything has a positive and a negative side and here the negative side is that after G4 you take here the F4 Square can become very weak so G4 is a very powerful move A4 played here by Arjun and now how should white play here take okay he takes and I think you should take with the pawn that's what he does Pawn takes on F3 and David now goes King to E7 his King comes up to E7 and how does Arjun make progress here does he start pushing his B Pawn he first goes Rook D1 and he offers a trade maybe not the best the best move was B4 because after Rook D1 I think David Goes Rook B2 yes he plays it here and now he stops the pawns from advancing for a bit but Rook DB1 he plays Rook a B1 and you will see how David paravian doesn't want the Rooks to be traded so he goes Rook A2 but Arjun says well it's one thing to trade Rooks but if my Rooks get two open files I will take it with both hands and now the threat is Rook C7 check and winning the bishop so Knight comes to E8 and this Rook while it's very nicely placed this Rook does not have any entry spots so maybe you can swing it over in this fashion so yes Arjun does go Rook D4 and then after Bishop A6 now Rook B4 looks like the very likely way to continue he plays Rook B4 slowly and steadily arj J is getting control over the position the Knight would have loved to be active here but it is passively positioned and E5 is a very very big error because now this Pawn could become potentially weak and also the fifth and the sixth rank become weak Rook C5 Arjun immediately takes advantage of this and goes Rook to C5 and David now has to play f 6 to protect it but now the F6 Pawn can also become a weakness and we could also go Rook B6 hitting the bishop here he goes Rook C6 which is also cool move uh but David now starts to create play on the king side he wants to take this Pawn but Arjun has everything worked out it seems he gives a check and now the King has to go on the last rank but which side is the question he he goes King d8 and while you cannot really bring your king up because there would be a discovered check and you lose the Rook Arjun is not interested in uh in that pawn to defend this Pawn he's actually going after the Knight the Knight comes to C7 uh however now it's all over because you can just take on F6 and defend the pawn on F3 and in this way The Rook has managed to chop off a critical Pawn the next few moves were pretty easy both sides just made some moves Arjun brought his Rook on the other side and then he chopped another Pawn off and another and I think at some point he was four pawns up and now I think bringing the Rook back on D2 is a great move also notice you can't take the pawn here because check and it's lost so David resigns and Arjun manages to win a very crucial game with this he moves to 6 and half out of8 and is now the sole leader of the Qatar master 2023 with one round to go"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

Hans Neiman and with it as always goes into his ritual of closing his eyes and focusing when asked what does he do in this time he said he would rather not reveal it so we do not know what he does what does he think but his opponent is Hans Neiman and Hans has played really well in this tournament he beat Richard raport he beat shamin wov he is on three and half out of five VI it on the other hand started off with a loss and then scored three back-to-back wins before drawing his last game against Eleni ner and there he's back and he plays Pawn up to E4 he pushes his Pawn to E4 and let's see what Hans NE comes up with is Hans going to go for something very active or will he play the super solid E4 E5 Hans also takes his time because you know withit can play E4 or D4 can also go C4 Knight F3 he plays all the opening lines but right now both of them are very much attracted by the game on the next board between Shiro and raport so they are looking there but Hans now has a decision to make he pushed es his Pawn to E5 so it's E4 E5 and with it brings out his Knight to F3 it'll be interesting to see whether we get a Ru Lopez we get a Italian Knight comes out to C6 this will be exciting and VI it does go for the ru Lopez he plays Bishop to B5 and Hans immediately questions the bishop do you want to take on C6 or do you want to move back he goes back to A4 and now Hans goes Knight to F6 very classical play very normal and now vidit simply shot castles it out this opening has been played thousands of times at top level chess and Hans goes for the closed variation of the ru Lopez by playing Bishop to E7 and with it plays Rook E1 B5 played to push the bishop Bishop away and now the bishop comes back to B3 notice that black can go now D6 as one of the main lines or could Castle Hans castles it out which means that he's ready to go for the Marshall in case with it goes C3 D5 is a pawn sack so with it goes for A4 which is also known as the anti- Marshal Bishop B7 played by Hans just so that the Rook is defended and now with with it pushes his Pawn to D3 a very solid opening and Hans also pushes his Pawn to D6 generally when you look at these structures you would imagine that nothing special is happening but white is putting the bishop controlling the A5 Square so the Knight cannot jump there and now plays his Pawn up to H3 and the Knight goes to d8 this is a very nice maneuver the Knight can go to E6 and the pawn can move ahead so with it takes the pawn and really like how with it deals with this it's very instructive and a lot can be learned from it so First Pawn takes pawn and now the Rooks have to be traded so he takes Rook takes A8 now the bishop will capture The Rook back and Hans does that and now the move that with it you can see his time he's still at 141 which is means he's in preparation he plays his Knight to C3 putting pressure on the B5 Pawn Knight E6 played by Hans he's looking at these two important squares and wish with it chops it off now you can't take with the queen because B5 is hanging so that's the reason why Pawn takes solidifying these two squares and opening the rook's path but this next move is fantastic B4 fixing the weakness here on B5 Bishop B7 Hans says I want to bring my Rook over and control the a file for my Rook with it says sorry I'm going to take control of the a file and enter with the queen Han says no chance in the world he plays his Rook to A8 attacking with its Queen now the queen goes to B2 you can see with it 1 hour 42 minutes he started off with 1 hour 40 minutes and now has 2 minutes extra on the clock at six played by Hans and with it brings his Rook to trade off another pair of Rooks this will be interesting to see if Hans takes it or not he exchanges it but now the downside is that after Queen takes A1 with it has the free control of the a file King comes up Hans wants to keep all his pieces together but now with it moves in and attacks the bishop even this Pawn is attacked you know that but Hans quietly plays his bishop and tells with it well nothing much is happening you know I'm I'm very cool here and now with it brings his Queen to A5 keeping these two pawns under attack and Hans goes back to G8 well black doesn't have too many plans here Bishop E3 is a nice move because what with it might want to do is go this way and attack this Pawn King at seven black is biting his time trying to make some useful moves Bishop A7 played the game starts to get very interesting positionally will with it be able to put more pressure that's the question Bishop d8 H says no chance my Bishop is defending this pawn queen A6 with it again slowly like death approaching the position and Hans plays Bishop E7 he's like if you play Bishop B8 I'll go back to d8 and defend it Bishop B8 played by with it and Hans plays King G you can see he's waiting there he realizes that with it can attack but he can defend and what a beautiful move by vidit he's bringing in another piece from D2 to B3 to A5 what a beautiful maneuver there by vidit Gujarati and Hans goes Knight H5 he's actually trying to attack here he wants to go to F4 with it stops it with his Pawn to G3 but now Hans realizes that his only option here is to attack the black white king if he doesn't do it with its Knight will come here and just completely destroy his position so he goes Queen E8 nice move the queen can move here try to put pressure on the white king side but vidit starts to escape with his King whoa what a decision by vidit Gujarati King F1 played very surprising move well maybe what withd it wants to do is start running away this way to B2 and he thinks his king would be very safe here very smart idea King at s but the problem is if you start to run here at the right time D5 may come in so with it stays in the center with King E2 and Hans also Waits with Queen D7 King D1 played and now Knight goes to G8 What a waiting game here both players maneuvering around with it plays his Knight to B3 the only problem is that his light squares are a bit too weak will Hans be able to take advantage of it he goes 97 well what is the Knight doing here is a big question with it now moves in with his Knight here attacking the bishop on C6 and Hans plays Queen E8 and he's like look my knight defends here and I'm ready to come out and attack your knight here so with it goes and defends his King with his King but D5 fantastic move by Hans nean lot of pressure now on with it you can see he's down to 7 minutes on the clock he plays Knight D2 not a move that you make happily especially because this check is coming in this is fantastic the point is if you would have taken this Pawn there is a check and there's counter play so here with it goes back to E1 and now the bishop is hanging so Bishop D7 is played with it goes Queen B7 nice little move putting pressure on the black queen side D takes E4 not a good idea Hans had a drawing line with Queen H3 Bishop E8 and Bishop H5 but it was too difficult to spot and now with it is better here even though Hans is going to chop off this Pawn this Pawn is not that relevant as much as white is going to get from chopping the C7 Pawn yes he takes it and you will see that all these three pieces are not so well placed so check on H1 played and the King comes up to E2 and now Queen H5 check the king goes oh he goes Knight F3 he plays his Knight there and now Hans comes back with his Queen now you can take off this Pawn that seems like a very nice juicy Pawn to capture also with it has a lot of time yes he takes it Knight takes E5 he's completely crushing this position Hans Neiman is a pawn down his pieces are very passive he goes Bishop C8 Queen B8 is a fine move but with it takes his time and makes an error Queen A7 because now Knight G6 gets him counterplay very good move by Hans if you take Knight takes G6 Queen G6 with counter play and he takes on d8 but now the point is black can take Knight E5 and the game becomes once again very very sharp the reason is after Knight E5 the queen can enter with the attack and the Queen and Knight can be a deadly combo with it goes Queen C7 defending this bishop attacking the Knight Hans gives a check fantastic move move and now what does with it do his position once again which was looking completely winning is unclear Hans must play Bishop D7 with the idea of maybe getting the bishop to that side and he's completely fine here no he is moving his Knight he gives a check that is a blunder it's a big mistake because now the bishop here is trapped on C8 it can't do much and that is big problem it was very difficult to calculate everything King C3 played by with it Queen H1 and you can see H threat is if you take your queen A1 check and in fact it's black who checkmates his opponent so that cannot be done that cannot be done with it can't take it but he has the right move in mind King B2 and now the bishop is still trapped Knight D2 with the idea of check and is it a mate oh Bishop F6 what a beautiful move there's a mate threatened here and most importantly the bishop is going to defend here like after check King A3 there's no more a check on A1 because the bishop controls that square and you can see there Hans shaking his head he knows that he's blundered there with Knight D2 and with it so confident sitting there and he knows that the win is in the back but he's still very focused for all counterplay that can happen on the board this move Bishop F6 is such a pretty move because it threatens mate in one and it also defends on the other side that's how powerful this move is and Hans nean can't do anything here I guess maybe resignation is on the cards he has 5 minutes 50 seconds he fought really well in this game however vidit was the one who made the second to last mistake it was Hans who made the final one he gives a check with the queen of course you want to go King A3 and that's exactly what he does he goes to A3 and now there's no check on A1 so he gives Queen C1 check but now the bishop can come back to B2 exactly that's what he plays and resignation by Hans what a game this was by withit a positional dominance there but Hans really fought hard in the end it was victory for with it who played really really well and has moved to four and a half out of six with the rest day coming in a big victory for the Indian 29-year-old grandmas"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

the world of Chess Hikaru Nakamura takes on Fabiano Karana Hikaru has the white pieces this is the penultimate round at the FID Grand Swiss and Hikaru opens the game with one E4 and presses the clock Fabiano responds with the very very solid E5 and now what is Hikaru going to do he plays his Knight out to F3 Karana brings his Knight to F6 wo it's the Petro will Hikaru take on E5 no he goes for Knight C3 and this is the Four Knights which is going to be in action it's considered to be quite a solid opening for white but generally games end in draws at the highest level Karana takes the pawn and now after Knight takes D4 the main line Contin continues with Bishop coming out to B4 and that is exactly what Fabby does now the Knight is pinned so the threat is to take the pawn so Hikaru takes first on C6 and you take it back B takes C6 this has all been seen thousands of times Bishop D3 defending the pawn here on e4 and now Karana plays his Pawn in the center D5 Hikaru chops the pawn off and Karana now castles it out it's quite risky to take this Pawn because there is this Theory with Bishop G4 which is quite well known at the top level and that's the reason why Hikaru castles it out and now Fabby takes on D5 and now for white he plays his Pawn to H3 this is a move that was popularized by kramnik earlier the main move used to be Bishop G5 and after H3 C6 has been played but karan's move Bishop E6 is not so well known although hekaru is blitzing out his moves he's well prepared and now Pawn up to C5 even Karana is well prepared so this is opening Theory and also Hikaru plays his next move quickly Rook D1 so that C4 cannot be played you take the pawn and The Rook is opposite the queen but this move was played after quite some thought and Karana takes the Knight Queen E7 has been played before but now Hikaru takes the pawn back notice that white has the bishop pair both his Bishops nicely positioned but Fabby goes Queen A5 and he tells his opponent that I'm attacking this Pawn although it's not really hanging because if you take here you can take on H7 and take the queen and Knight E4 ooh that's a classy move and here if you take yes that's what is done Pawn takes you will see that we already have opposite colored Bishop positions so after Pawn takes if Hikaru were to take Queen E4 then Fabby would take this pawn and the position is drawish that's the reason why Hikaru plays Queen G3 a very smart move he still seems like in his prep 1 hour 42 minutes Karana moves his King away the thing about opposite colored Bishops is is that it can be drawish but on the other hand if one side is able to attack then it can become an Unstoppable attack because both Bishops never meet each other so it's like you have an extra piece in the attack Rook E8 played by Karana and Hikaru now thinks for a bit and brings his Rook to D6 a good move taking control of the D B6 Square also trying to double the Rooks H6 a grave error by Fabby this is not at all a good move let's look at hikaru's expression you can see there maybe he does not like it but the main reason why this move is not good is because white can now double up on this pawn and sacrifice his Bishop at the right moment Rook E7 played by karwana he is getting uncomfortable here and now Rook E1 is a strong move but Hikaru goes Queen E3 again you can see the queen and Bishop line up against the six Pawn Rook C8 played by Fabby and this is already a losing position Hikaru sacks beautiful move because if you take I take with the queen king G8 Rook E1 Rook E3 to G3 and it's a devastating attack that's the reason why Karana plays F6 and Hikaru chops off another Pawn you can't take here because now Rook takes E6 is hanging so clearly Karana in big trouble he takes on C3 that was his calculation but can Hikaru move his Rook away Rook E1 he brings his Rook to D1 which is also a nice move and he's threatening Rook d8 check Rook E8 played by fabii and now he wants to move his Bishop away but Hikaru plays Rook d8 great move because if you play Bishop F7 I can simply take the Rook this is pinned that's the reason why Karana plays Bishop G8 to break this pin however now Hikaru can move his Queen away Queen H4 played well very strong was Queen G6 that was a very powerful move but he goes Queen H4 and Karana takes on C2 so black is doing okay Rook D3 played by Hikaru but White's attack looks very strong you can see there Bishop at7 is played to block the checks but now Hikaru brings his rook in what a move G5 instantly played by Karana is down to a minute he still has to make 13 moves it's going to be very difficult and queen G3 played you can see Hikaru has a spring in his step he knows that he can win 2 seconds left queen B1 check given and now King H2 look at the black king so we can look at these four Rooks just opposite each other and now Karana brings his Queen back to F5 Hikaru is completely winning here his Bishop looks trapped but actually it's it's a very powerful Bishop Rook takes Rook karwana takes the other rook and now how do you finish off the game Queen C7 attacking here also putting pressure here and also threatening Queen G7 check so Karana now trades the Queens with Queen F4 but after take Pawn takes you can see that the pawns are equal for the time being but now after check you can first take the pawn on F6 let's exactly what he does threatening now Rook check and picking up this bishop so Bishop B1 Karana saves his Bishop but now he's going to lose another Pawn oh first Hikaru being very very precise here H he doesn't go for the A7 Pawn he can actually take on A7 but it seems like he's calculated till the end that the opposite colored Bishop end game is winning so he takes here King takes and Bishop to G5 the pawn is hanging and if you lose the pawn it's a lost position so he goes G4 and he'll now bring his King up and he has two passers also the C Pawn is a passed Pawn but it is very very easily blocked by the Bishop from queening and now after Bishop E4 he brings his Bishop to D2 the bishop is coming to C3 we are reaching Moon number 40 Hikaru will have a lot of time and Karana says I resigned game is over what a victory by Fabian by Hikaru Nakamura beating Fabiano Karana fantastic chess there and there you can see them analyzing clearly Hikaru played better chess but it's wonderful to see Karana analyzing and also you know after such a heartbreaking loss because this takes away his chance from finishing at the top in this tournament and with this win Hikaru makes a very very bold claim towards getting a candidate spot should"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

Berlin has been played and anti Berlin with the move D3 Bishop C5 played and now generally the main moves are C3 and Bishop C6 but nihal goes for Bishop G5 pinning the Knight here and this leads to Sharp and exciting games the time control is 15 minutes plus 10 seconds increment and H6 played by Sunan Bishop H4 played keeping the pin and now D6 played by black maybe not the most accurate way to play but that's interesting nihal goes C3 he's just playing this flexibly keeping all his options open Bishop goes back and now Knight would come out to D2 and that's what he does he brings his Knight out black has a question here does he want to Castle or not Bishop D7 played sunon keeps it flexible keeps his King in the center nihal comes after the bishop this is already looking quite good for nihal serin here because winning that important Bishop on B6 is very good for him but Knight E7 played and Sunan does something interesting that he says if you're going to anywhere win my Bishop I want you to trade the other Bishops so that you won't be left with Bishop pair but on the other hand nihal is in no hurry to actually get this bishop here he first cast it out and later on can start pushing his pawns on the queen side wo San also castles this is a bit risky because the black's King position is a bit exposed Rook comes to E1 and nihal is angling for the central breakthrough with D4 Queen C6 played so that you can play A6 and when you take here the queen can take back A4 played A6 and I think nihal must now take this bishop off it's an important Bishop but first he goes H4 a nice move there nihal is going on the attack with 12 minutes against sun and 7 G4 pushing the Knight away Knight H2 attacking the pawn now this this Pawn needs to be protected it's attacked twice you have to play H5 what is sunon going to do because the moment you play H5 all the dark squares become weak and nihal quickly goes King H1 he wants to break with F3 and not have this bishop looking at this diagonal so Sunan keeps the bishop intact maybe wiser was to actually take this bishop but now Nal goes here trying to enter the best move here is Knight at seven with a very key point that F5 takes and queen E8 this was an important defensive idea but he goes King G7 and now nihal can jump in with the queen it's a check Knight goes in and Knight F1 what a beautiful maneuver the Knight is coming from E3 to F5 and you can see Nial sitting back in his chair with 9 Minutes 57 seconds on the clock he's playing Super Quick and now ruk played and nihal quickly goes in with his Knight it feels like sun's position is going to dis great here if the Knight comes to F5 Knight G8 played and I think it's time for a check the king moves back but it's not so easy to finish him off Rook F1 with the idea of breaking with F3 and The Rook looks against the F7 Pawn the queen moves back in defense what is nihal going to do next who he goes D4 he's now wanting to open up his bishop and already the pressure on E5 is more so he takes on D4 and now will nihal take it back but there is a knight sacrifice in the who he sacrifices his Knight because if takes this bishop takes Knight here and I can take with the bishop oops not take here take here and check and The Rook Falls so that's the reason why this was taken sunon goes here and nihal takes back the pawn keeping his night o PRI sunnan takes here Bishop takes now nihal is a piece down but look at his pieces in the attack the Knight is pinned Rook at seven to control the G7 square but now Nial can bring another piece into the attack with Rook C1 and he does that The Rook wants to enter here so Bishop B6 controlling the C7 Square what's next now F3 bringing the other Rook into the attack wow Bishop d8 played defense defending the Knight and maybe at some point the queen could be attacked nihal takes the pawn opening up here the king needs to move away King E8 but he plays King G8 now this is a mistake but the reputation is not so easy Rook sacrific there by Nial seren if you take here Knight E7 is coming so he takes on F5 Nial takes the queen he takes the queen back right now black is two pieces up but after nihal's next move both of Black's pieces are attacked and this means that the material is going to be recovered you can see sunon shaking his head he has 20 seconds left while nihal has 3 minutes and now G3 what a classy move here by nihal trapping the Knight if you count the number of Pawns nihal is two pawns up a beautiful attack has transpired he takes the Rook King takes and now he can pick up the Knight yes the position has clarified a bit and black is just a pawn down but look at this Central clump of Pawns it's so powerful the king moves up to G2 and maybe it'll go to H3 Bishop comes back to G5 and now it's time to push your Pawns in the center of the board Nial keeping a very steady Edge on the time with 3 minutes left for him and sunnon down to 40 seconds he pushes his Pawn to E5 and I think it's time to resign this game for Sun and suo he takes on E5 because otherwise nihal would have even pushed it further and now Pawn takes and these two Central Pawns are just too strong here 30 seconds left what is black going to do and sudden plays Rook C8 he wants to come down here with Rook C2 check and nihal is thinking it's time for his move 3 minutes 13 seconds pushes his Pawn to F6 and F7 f8 is coming the game is all over sanjiro resigns a beautiful attacking Masterpiece here by nihal serin especially the moves Knight takes on D6 and also Rook C7 beautiful

The chess moves of the match are provided as input.", "input": "dear viewers! | Nihal Sarin vs Pragg | Game 5 | Commentary by Sagar", "output": "with the score now 3-1 in the favor of prananda it's high time for nihal to strike back he opens the game with Knight F3 Knight comes out to F6 and he plays the English opening with C4 you can see prag pausing there trying to make sure what he wants to do E6 and he goes for the very solid setup with E6 D5 but then he pauses and he's like do I want to go so solid or do I want to be a little bit more ambitious and ambitious as it is he pushes his Pawn again which is actually not a great idea in the opening you have to make as few pawn moves as possible but these top players know that with a Pawn on D4 you have more space but look at White's development it's been very quick he's castled himself and so it's time for Nial to perhaps do something active in the center but breaking is not possible because after Pawn takes he loses the pawn here so can he figure figure out a way to take advantage of his slight lead in development and do something or will prananda solidify with moves like castle and E5 Knight E1 played by nihal he wants to kick the bishop away and that's how he's continuing prag anyway castles it out and the Knight does come to C2 the bishop goes back and now still pushing the pawn might not be easy so he goes B3 maybe the bishop can come here and put pressure on the pawn uh but it's not so simple how to how to attack it E5 played and now A3 so that's the plan when black plays in the center you want to start playing on the queen side that's how nihal wants to do and maybe he'll put his Rook on B1 and then engineer this B4 break 2 minutes 32 seconds for nihal 2 minutes 20 seconds for prag he goes Bishop F5 Rook B1 as we anticipated and queen C8 nice idea you want to put your Bishop on H3 and trade one of White's Defenders and look at this move if Bishop H3 comes nihal will simply drop back his Bishop so that the Rook is not hanging that's the plan rookie 8 played and now white gets the queen side play Rolling the bishop drops back and the plan is to push the queen side Pawns there by white so nihal serin has got this very nice break and he pushes the pawn even further asking prug what your idea is well prug says I'm going to B8 to D7 to C5 this is a nice home that you've given my knight and A4 played the Knight now ooh PR Waits and plays his Knight to D7 Knight Knight comes to B3 and you can see there's pressure here here and here I I like White's position but I like the attacking chances that black has because you know this Pawn on D4 gives so much space and this king is a bit lonely for white so if black can play Bishop H3 H5 H4 that would be some huge attack coming down nihal has 2 minutes to figure out what is his next plan and he wants to maybe put a knight here on B3 and that's the reason why he goes Knight A1 he wants to play Knight B3 hit here hit here and if he can push his Pawn to C5 nothing like it so definitely Bishop H3 is a key idea here if you put your Bishop back maybe a central break so already black has all these plans up his sleeve but prananda is thinking a bit longer than normal he has 1 minute 25 seconds what is he thinking about I mean H5 looks like a normal oh he goes and plays in the center straight away nihal does not even take a second he simply plays his Knight to B3 attacks the bishop the bishop comes in and attacks The Rook so now do you want to play a bishop here because if you play your Bishop to D2 you have to calculate this very sharp move E3 that could make the game very tense nihal 1 minute 30 seconds goes Rook F1 he puts his Rook on the side and now will PR push his Pawn further no he takes it takes and creates a weakness on the D3 square and he attacks the queen now you never want to play F3 because it Blocks Your Bishop it weakens the E3 Square so nihal goes Bishop F3 and offers a trade of Bishops to prag because if prag takes then the queen comes here on this beautiful diagonal so PR goes Bishop H3 attacks the rook and uh Rook is trapped Rook can't go here the bishop is waiting for it so Bishop had to go back prag plays his Pawn to C5 he's not in a mood to even repeat with Bishop G4 C5 played and maybe nihal must take oppas saw if he wants to create counterplay in the position that should be the idea he's thinking hard here and one minute to Nial now one plan that prag has is that if you take here he wants to take take and take with the queen with a check that is his plan but nihal can actually put his Queen here and in that ensuing position this Pawn would be a weakness for white and this Pawn would be a weakness for black will nihal go for it he's kind of assessing ing this position that could arise but look at his time he has only 30 seconds and in the match he's already two points down this is a very tough situation to be in he takes the pawn bishop takes Bishop by prag King takes and now most likely he'll take with the queen because the check I mean who could resist the temptation of this nice juicy check Queen F3 and now you know prag can keep his Queen because if he keeps the queen Queens on the board there will be some play against the white king but if you take it this end game might be torturous for black because the D4 Pawn becomes a very shot weakness again look at this how in a Blitz game prag and nihal are both taking their time for critical decisions whether to trade the Queens whether to keep them on the board and that's what makes them excellent players but prag I I guess he's tempted by taking the queen takes and nice Moon Knight D7 he wants to play this so if you take here he wants to give this check if the king comes here there would be a disco and so nihal first goes Rook D1 and says look PR I'll defend my Pawn now your Pawn is still hanging how do you defend that the simple idea is Knight check King moves back and Knight C6 that would be the right way to proceed but PR goes Bishop C3 maybe not the best maybe not the best idea and perhaps nihal should just trade off this bishop so just to weaken this even further Bishop D2 is an idea Bishop B2 is an idea but 14 seconds for n oh prag is already down to 11 seconds they're down to their last 10 seconds Bishop B2 played okay what is PR going to do now he has to give a check I believe go for a check put your knight on C6 goes Rook A6 whoa he wants to swing his Rook over there and nihal takes oh he takes the the D4 Pawn maybe prug missed that the bishop controls the square he missed it check with Just 2 seconds King goes back he trades the bishop Rook takes now prag is a pawn down nihal has won a pawn Rook comes in and pawn moves to B6 but this is a weakness this is a weakness Knight F3 oh he had 1 second left my god did you see that nihal had just one second left on it he's shaking there he's shaking he just needs to get a few seconds but you can see there now he's ped up to 6 seconds that's Nial serin for you once he starts rolling it's very difficult to stop him prug has also very little time he attacks this pawn and now guys look the dust has settled white has an extra Pawn but PR pins the pawn nihal brings the Knight the Knight is attacked the Knight attacks The Rook The Rook goes oh with one second again Rook F5 how do these players play with just one second I'll collap there Rook C5 and he goes Rook back to A7 but now the Knight can come to D5 and trade no he goes Rook C4 it's still a drawish position because this Pawn is going nowhere but in a Blitz game it's very difficult nihal pushes his Pawn to H4 5 seconds he brings his Knight in The Rook defends the Knight the Knight defends the pawn white is in the driver's seat but can prag trick nihal he goes back King to and attacks The Rook the pawn is attacked they repeat twice but now Rook B7 again the Knight attacks and the King comes out white king is moving in and that's a big mistake but can nihal find the check oh finds it because if Knight takes then King takes Rook what a move found by nihal serin because now this cuts the king off he has to go here and he goes Rook d8 attacking the Knight and Rook end game is lost because the black king is rank cut off yes King C4 played by nihal the king comes in and there's no way that nihal has any issues here Rook B6 and Rook E3 check King coming in prananda resigns nihal Strikes Back score is 3-2"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

main line is D4 with open Sicilian he goes Knight C3 Knight to F6 played by nihal and you can literally sense the confidence in nihal's body language after he won the last game D4 played by prag Pawn takes we have the open Sicilian on the board Knight takes D4 and now A6 the nidorf the very popular nidorf has been played and let's see how prag counters it he goes for the fian shto system with G3 the Knight drops back to E2 and white will now play his Bishop to G2 and Castle so Bishop E7 Bishop G2 black castles White Castles both sides have had a very solid formation but the play will revolve around the D5 Square because that has been weakened it's a weak square and prug instantly takes control of it he plays his Knight there now nihal can play Bishop B7 but then after take take the D5 Square remains weak so what he does he sort of bolsters the Knight there prug bolsters his own Knight and the bishop comes in and now he attacks the queen Side Pawn with A4 so prag playing pretty quickly after that quite a long thing on move number four he has gained time and is ahead on the clock Bishop takes the Knight and now Knight takes Knight takes and PR takes with the pawn he realizes that he has given up the weakness on Def 5 but on the other hand he now has a very nice pawn and a majority on the queen side that he would like to push also not to forget white has the bishop pair nihal plays his Queen to C7 he says that I have my own trumps the semiopen C file The Rook swinging over so there's a lot to play for also the bishop is not particularly great on G2 it can pop out on H3 so Pawn takes Pawn takes the Rooks are Trad and now the queen comes into D3 attacking the pawn on B5 nihal has to play this carefully because it could happen that very soon he will get into the prag bind where prag loves to grind these equal is positions one thing is that you can push your Pawn here to B4 but then it does become a bit weak so nihal plays Queen to B 7 he defends the pawn and prag now plays his Bishop here his idea is to plon the bishop on B4 where it would put pressure on the D6 pawn and look at PR's time now he has 2 minutes 30 seconds nihal has 1 minute 30 seconds so clearly from the time utilization you can sense who is more comfortable in a game is it prag or is it nihal right now it's clearly prananda who's feeling the ease feeling the flow Knight comes to C5 hitting the queen and now the queen has to move where should it move because the Knight controls the square Queen E3 looks like a good Square you can also drop back your queen to E2 there's also Queen to C3 plenty of options there prag also slowing down now trying to figure out what is the best way for him to continue if prag imagine can play B4 kick the Knight out then play C4 exchange these pawns he will have a passer he goes Queen E2 can Nial already start entering on the seventh rank he goes B4 but this is a risky move because he's given up the C4 square and the White Queen can now settle in here however imagine that if you can play B3 and queen C4 if you get both these moves then that would be very very powerful prag plays Queen C4 four but nihal has his next move ready the concrete move of playing B3 so nihal on his own going and exchanging pawns which means that prag would get a ped Pawn now look at this this is a passed Pawn however he believes in his position nihal believes that his Knight which will come to D4 will be an absolute monster so first The Rook is traded sorry Rook is attacking the Queen the queen has to move but where exactly do you go to D3 three do you go to G4 oh G4 is an interesting move you can keep pressure here very strategic game quite different from all the Tactical battles that these players have been having and the fast-paced games this is a slightly more positional game G6 played by nihal and maybe he wants to just move his Bishop this way or from the other side put it on G7 and start pushing his kingside pawns that is the idea here H4 played by prag and H5 by nihal serin now the queen has to move and he goes back Queen E2 somehow it does feel that Black's position is more harmonious but White's position has more potential if black goes wrong especially with the bishop pair and the outside P Pawn he goes King H2 but now nihal slowly and steadily making slight improvements in his position first getting the bishop there then the king moves up Queen comes up to E3 and now the Knight settles down in the center of the board Queen comes to D3 how does nihal continue the pressure you can again look at the times and you will feel the flow going in another Direction this time the flow is going in nihal's way F4 played what a risky move because it kind of opens up the second rank here Queen B6 nihal bolsters his Knight in the center so that if pontic Pawn he can take it with the bishop goes Bishop E4 some pressure here here maybe you want to push the pawn to F5 and this King can get a bit lonely here he takes the pawn very interesting nihal sarin look at the calmness on his face Rook takes F4 and now the bishop comes to the center of the board attacking The Rook look at PR's time oh he sacrifices with just 13 seconds what is the sacrifice firstly if you take here then he would like to take this piece as it opens up and secondly if you take the Rook then I take the Knight with the check and your queen Falls so very interesting sacrifice there by prananda Bishop takes and he's now a pawn up because the queen is hanging here and nihal sarin does look a bit tensed now suddenly he from a good position he's landed into this tactical fight Bishop takes Queen takes and they're going into a rook end game where prag is a pawn up nihal moves to the seventh rank 15 seconds Rook comes back and he brings his King in I think nihal has figured out that he has enough activity to keep balance in the position Rook A4 and although prananda is a pawn up it's not so easy to make progress especially because this Pawn is weak so is this Pawn Rook moves up nihal attacks the pawn on B2 the pawn is also moved ahead now this Rook is doing double duty it has to defend D5 as well as B3 so not so easy for prag to make progress but he does what is very logical he brings this King to the other side where it can defend this Pawn so King moves forward King C2 Rook check here and now the king moves away Rook goes back King here check Rook C3 and The Rook comes here and they agree to a draw wo that was an intense game with this the score now stands 3 and2 2 and2 in prags favor"}, {"instruction": "Generate a

Shak attack shakar mamaro and with black we have Iden suan Lee shakri plays D4 and Iden plays Knight F6 and we have the trosi Iden is not at all surprised and plays his Pawn to D5 E3 played Shak is known for his very very weird style of Chess creative way of playing chess and Iden who is the young upcoming Talent of aeran counters it in a very classical fashion developing his pieces controlling the center and so on in terms of uh the battle that we see here one can say that this is something like vishi Anand taking on prananda or gukesh in India because mamaro is an absolute Legend in aeri Chess By the way the bishop is attacked you can drop it back which would be a good move but instead he takes Pawn takes and now the structure is a bit ruined here for black and look at that mamaro goes in with his Queen and what does Iden do he's ready with his move so quickly he's hovering around the rook and plays Rook G8 maybe his idea is Bishop to G4 so for example if you go Knight F3 already Bishop G G4 is uncomfortable so mamaro plays H3 to stop that move but already one can start feel feeling that what is the queen doing here this is not weak this is not weak the queen is a bit weirdly placed and look at Iden playing in the center right in the center of the board fantastic chess hitting there and now what does shakri do he long castles well for mamaro it's like if he said a he must say say B and then C and the game will get very exciting now what does black do here Iden puts his Queen on B6 and tells mamed diaro that I am not afraid of your slight lead in development I'm not even afraid that my king is in in the center I've just put my queen here it's well positioned and he takes on E5 I think you just take back F5 look at that beautiful Center here now the Knight develops attacking here and Bishop E6 very nice move because if you take this Pawn I have Rook G5 with a double attack so that does not work at all so mamed aro's move which was Knight F3 didn't have a threat and Iden actually called it out king B1 played now still this is not hanging so you don't have to worry Rook G5 is still a possibility there so maybe it's time to Long Castle Iden brings his hand towards this King and yes he long castles as well look at Black's position guys strong center Bishop pair Rook on the open file Queen nicely placed King very safe what does mamaro have out of the opening that's the reason why the position is utterly lost this Pawn was hanging so he goes and defends it with his Queen now Bishop C5 makes a lot of sense because you are looking at the F2 Square which is very difficult to defend in fact it's just a free Pawn there and Idan has touched his Bishop it seems but he goes the full distance he goes Bishop A3 and his idea is very simple Checkmate in one Knight B3 comes to block the check okay the bishop is now hanging so it has to move back also Bishop C5 no longer possible as the Knight will take the bishop so he goes D4 wo what a move because if you take here then he Iden wants to take take take here check King C1 and D Tak C3 with a winning attack so clearly that cannot be taken mamaro pushes his Pawn to C4 and now the bishop comes back hitting the queen on H4 the queen has to move again but where does the queen go Queen goes to H5 shakri of course known for his trappy style of play will have to come up with something clever here Iden pushes his Pawn to F5 slowly he wants to push E4 as well but look at this move now he's attacking the bishop the bishop needs to be saved and I think a logical move now is to drop the bishop back to F7 Iden does he play that brings his hand near the bishop and plays it to F7 it's a good move and if given time black would love to push his Pawn to E4 then to D3 then all of the white pieces are just very very passive he goes H4 he goes H4 and now if you play E4 notice that the D4 Pawn is not hanging because I have one two and three Defenders so let's go E4 Iden now down to 3 minutes 36 seconds and he pushes his Pawn to E4 well done this is a good move and somehow you need to make a move like if you play a move like C5 then just Bishop C5 loses that pawn so he goes Knight G5 that was the idea of the H4 move that was played Knight is now attacking the bishop do you want to take this Rook h8 played again I love this move fantastic move here Queen is attacked and with Queen G7 now Iden gets his Bishop to H5 Square yes with this he attacks The Rook if the Rook is moved away somewhere then already the queen is trapped on G8 G7 so G4 played here the game is getting very very exciting but not really for mamaro fans because Iden is simply crushing him he's once again attacked his rook and what do you do I think shakri really needs to pay focus on this Rook G8 Queen trap and that's why he goes Bishop H3 his point is if you take here maybe he'll just First Take and then take on D1 but that's also winning for black so actually Iden has many options but takes on H4 which is also a nice move it's a fantastic move he's brought his rook in defending his Bishop but now the queen is not going to be trapped here he goes Rook to G1 and maybe now the safest way is to take on H3 that is the safest move but IID in doubles and this is not a good idea because now after Rook G4 takes in comes a very nice move take take Bishop G4 and I take here and white has some chances there but instead he goes Knight F7 and I think Rook H7 is a nice move by Iden suan Lee he says to mamedov that I'm attacking your queen also your Bishop can't move because it's spinned here on H1 uh check King C7 played and now what does mamedov do he's losing a piece here he needs to make a move Bishop G2 is a very sad move not at all in the style of mamaro he goes B Knight G G5 takes on G5 Queen takes on G5 but now can we simply not win a piece here with Rook takes H3 that's exactly what has been done pce up position for Iden Rook takes H3 and now you can take with the bishop but well why not with the Rook he takes with the Rook wow madaro down to 17 seconds but so is Iden both under sec in seconds and black king is slightly exposed so will there be some oh he sacrifices his Rook for the bishop he's now a full Rook down Iden takes here on G4 Queen F4 check now now you can't go to B8 that's covered C8 d8 possible but the moment you go to d8 the problem is that there's another check Queen f8 check so Idan needs to move again careful King D7 is met with Knight C5 and you have literally 7 seconds he needs to repeat he needs to go back to C7 good move Queen F4 if you go back King C8 there's Queen G4 check and you lose the Rook so only moon5 finds it with 9 seconds giving up a piece to then bring in the queen he's still an exchange up and he still has an extra Pawn so pawn and an exchange three points up here for black that was a very smart decision by Iden go back Queen D7 Iden don't move your king no he moves his King now Queen takes G E4 check well maybe there's Queen D7 so it's not so bad what a move by mamaro Knight takes D4 the Knight is coming into the game but I don't think that's a great idea because here he goes Rook H4 Rook H4 played here by Suleman Lee maybe not the best and now A3 it seems like White's Queen and Knight make a very deadly combo here A6 played maybe King A2 just tuck your king away is a great idea but with 7 seconds he gives a check Queen goes back he gives another check King moves to the side and now there's no check there 4 seconds for mamaro he gives another check maybe just tuck the king into the corner on A8 Iden has 26 seconds what is he thinking let's go let's go he goes king8 King goes to A2 now can you keep your nose here aidin suan Le the youngster here here hardly 17 years old and he's playing so well Queen D5 played and now how do you continue he brings his Rook to H7 he's kept his Edge he's not dropped it Knight B3 played and now what a beautiful move there E3 with this he creates the G passer that's so nice and puts his Rook behind the P Pawn fantastic Knight goes to the center of the board but somehow the Knight and queen are just not coordinating meanwhile Black's Pawn is pushing through Knight goes back to E2 Iden needs to push another Pawn G2 seems like a very good move he goes Queen G8 offering a trade of Queens of course you don't want to trade the Queens Queen goes back to D4 and now time to push another Pawn he pushes Knight comes to G1 so it's all very passive and now I and brings his Rook to G4 Pawn is pushed forward the rest should be easy Queen E8 attacking the E4 Pawn here and he brings his Queen to F2 take the pawn take the pawn queen E4 there's no Perpetual check here King here check here I can go B6 and then Queen B7 no he goes Queen C6 check King f8 check and now will Iden block yes he blocks it Queen B6 played C5 Pawn pushed forward Queen E6 played with a check B3 and now the queen goes to C6 cool move Knight E2 played and now Iden just wants to move his King yeah plays this King to B8 maybe there's a check here to gain some time mamaro pushes his Pawn to E5 but that's a blunder because now you can queen look at I in he pushes the pawn makes a queen and mamaro resigns because Knight G1 is met with Rook G2 and your queen drops"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

he takes on the young vidit Gujarati who is only 29 years old and is in the best form of his life having recently won the grand Swiss and also booking a spot to the candidates this is going to be a clash of generations and a very exciting game a handshake and we begin Boris as always pushes his Queen pawn and vid it as always gets into his Zone before the game does not make a move he's thinking about something he does not like to reveal it maybe someday in the future we'll get to know what his ritual is all about but for now let's focus on what his move is going to be he plays D5 the symmetrical variation and now Boris is going to play C4 for sure he plays the Queen's Gambit he doesn't like London system and all he likes the classical chess E6 played by vidit and now is Boris going to bring his Knight out to F3 yes he does Knight to F3 and with it will go ooh Knight D7 that's not very common generally black develops his Knight on F6 but I guess after Knight C3 with pressure on D5 Pawn we have transposed into this line of Knight bd7 early Knight bd7 Bishop F4 and I think with it has managed to get into to a rosan territory with Bishop B4 uh and he's happy that white has played the bishop F4 line now Pawn takes Pawn by bis with it takes back the pawn with the Rago in you are essentially telling white that look I want to pin you right now because I feel that the E4 square is very critical and my knight controls it and that's exactly what with it does he moves his Knight again and puts pressure on this diag meanwhile Boris simply develops his Queen and he says to with it I'm bringing my Bishop out and I'm castling G5 played by vidit and Bishop E5 attacking here The Rook now F6 can be played the bishop will drop back but instead with it takes the bishop Knight takes on E5 and Boris captures the Knight with his Knight this is getting very exciting and also don't miss out on the threat of Queen A4 check with it he plays C6 of course he's going to spot all these little traps that are there in the position now one thing that has happened with this move G5 is that the position is no longer very standard uh black king cannot feel very safe if it castles here but at the same time it doesn't feel safe in the center as well meanwhile White's King will simply Castle short so with it playing very dynamically hitting the Knight the Knight goes back and what does with it play he plays his Queen to E7 in a way just telling Boris that I'm happy with my position who he castles it out here now look the threat is to take take and win a pawn so either you take here with the bishop or you take with the Knight but taking with the Knight makes no sense I take back with the pawn and my Bishop opens up Pawn to C4 is possible so vidit has to play very carefully in this position his Knight on e4 is kind of keeping his position together he plays F5 to keep the Knight on that square but in return he's weakened the E5 square and Boris literally jumps in with his Knight Bishop goes back and with it says look I can now take this Knight but can you simply go F4 and just solidify the Knight on E5 is that an idea he goes F3 he goes F3 very interesting Chess By Boris gelfan takes and he takes with the queen adding protection to the E5 Knight fantastic and black castles here so black has the bishop pair while white has this beautiful Knight in the center maybe F4 seems like a logical move here he pushes it I like how Boris is playing this with it plays Bishop E6 but now guys can you simply not take here here Queen takes bring your Rook up bring the other Rook here and then the F5 Pawn is a lonely isolated Pawn that's exactly what Boris does and he tells with it with it with all the time on the clock like 13 minutes here what are you going to do my position is just completely better positionally look at that oh he goes Rook F3 he doesn't go Rook F4 but this looks even stronger there's an additional threat of winning the queen with Rook G3 King moves to h8 he brings brings the other rook in now this Pawn is very very weak and soft Bishop takes F5 could become a threat later Rook comes up to F6 now wow this is getting very exciting and VI it may want to bring his Rook to G8 but first Boris gelfan attacks his Queen Rook G3 you can literally sense that these two Bishops are not doing much meanwhile while each of White's pieces is doing phenomenally well in this position Queen moves back to H6 and with 5 minutes on the clock Boris has to figure out how is he going to attack he goes Rook H4 nice move with the idea of Rook H3 and Rook H4 putting pressure on the H7 point viit is actually positionally I I mean I could even say to this exch extend that he's positionally lost perhaps how is he going to fight look at that time from 10 minutes he's come down to 3 minutes on the clock and he's clearly worried here Boris now can simply play Queen B3 it's a nice move hassling this Pawn he goes Rook H3 which is also okay Queen goes back to G7 and now do we double the Rooks on the edge file I think we should we should put pressure there and he does it he puts pressure on the H7 pawn and with it now brings his Bishop back to G8 very interesting Rook H5 now pressure from this side maybe then Queen C2 hitting the pawn again takes on E5 but now Pawn takes notice how this queen can play a massive role on this diagonal if the pawn moves forward Rook goes to G6 with it is threatening the G2 Pawn but you can just simply defend it with G3 and that's exactly what he has done once again boris's idea Rook H4 Rook F4 put pressure here pile up with everything with it goes Rook G5 and he's offering a trade of Rooks should Boris take it well for the time being Boris simply moves his Rook ahead and maybe now next move after take he wants to put his Rook on the F4 Square take Rook takes and vidit pushes the pawn this is a big mistake this is a big mistake by vidit Will Boris find the reputation he first takes the pawn Rook takes and now this move has to be found Bishop F5 when The Rook is almost trapped because if Rook goes here Queen E1 E6 E7 no he doesn't play it he plays here Rook F5 which is not a good move because now with it can come back Bishop F5 was needed he goes Rook G4 but still white is pressing here Queen E1 good move he wants to push the pawn forward but can we now go Bishop E6 no he goes Queen E7 he goes Queen E7 and pushing the pawn yet is not possible so he goes Queen E3 boris's position does look so much Superior with this Rook pawn bishop how however at the same time with it says I also have counter plays fighting back with 20 seconds on the clock Boris has 10 he pushes his Pawn to E6 but now can we not simply push the pawn yes he does with its pawns look now very threatening in the center of the board a check comes in The Rook can simply move back and that is exactly what with it does now the bishop is hanging he has to save it and now the E6 Pawn is going to fall with this with it will win a crucial Pawn yes he plays it he takes the pawn it seems like the position has completely turned around from from a completely lost position with it has come back very powerfully in this game will he now win Queen B6 trade the Queens if you trade the Queens you will have no real trouble and your Pawn up yes he plays it trading the queen queen takes Queen you take back with the pawn extra Pawn Rook F4 now just Rook D7 another idea B5 B6 push your Rook here to A7 with it can you find that with 26 seconds this is going to be yes he finds it B5 Boris plays A3 but with It Go P6 Rook A7 B4 open it up bring your rook in and I think white is in trouble no he offers a rook trade he offers a rook trade what is going to happen in this bishop end game very unclear end game Boris gelfan is open to playing that end game but he's he's going to touch he plays King F2 but now can I take here take take D4 Bishop E4 the computer gives this as equal but this might be so so scary should with it take it it's a big decision no he doesn't take it he plays rookie 7 that's not the decision he wanted to make maybe when he went Rook F7 but he did not feel that the bishop end game was winning and so he kept the Rooks on but now white has got his pieces together coordinated and started pushing the kingside pawns these pawns are not going anywhere so with it goes rookie five and now Bor is slowly and steadily using his Trump cards what should with it do with just 10 seconds left he plays his Pawn to H6 he's still better here he has an extra Pawn but to convert this is not going to be easy let's go King f8 King E7 and try to improve the position of the king no he goes back to E7 it's not so easy to find wins in just 10 to 15 seconds or also good moves for that matter Rook C7 played by with it maybe he wants to break with C3 but in that he will break up his Pawn structure he goes King E2 King goes to E2 will with it pushes Pawn to C3 yes he does he pushes Pawn takes Rook takes Pawn A3 Pawn is hanging but Boris plays his Rook to D4 but but now isn't this hanging ah but he wants to take the pawn in the center so take Bishop takes and I think with it had this nice move Rook A4 because now if you take Pawn takes then this Pawn is just queening it's a very powerful Pawn so King E3 very nice move found by Boris gelf and he's seen that after take take take take the king and pawn end game is a draw wow that required some insane calculations with less time King F4 played and maybe now with it with 10 seconds is ready to repeat is he going to do that King comes back to E3 and maybe vidit should liquidate with 5 Seconds he takes on D5 Rook takes D5 Rook takes G4 and we are heading into a drawn end game what a game this has been with vidit Gujarati in big trouble and then later Boris gelfan fighting back it was amazing game they're ending in a draw"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

finishing at the top in the tournament he opens with E4 and we have Sicilian on the board PR of course a big fighter and he is looking to have a great fight against Arjun today Knight F3 Knight comes out to D6 will Arjun play the open Sicilian or go for the rosol Lio he goes for the open Sicilian D4 on the board I guess we're going to witness AES nikov happening Pawn takes pawn and Arjun takes back Knight takes and now the Knight comes out to F6 attacking the pawn on e4 and white defends Knight to C E3 black plays his Pawn up to E5 and yes we are inov territory now the D6 square is a bit weak of course D6 here this is all well-known Theory the main move here used to be Bishop G5 but since the karwana Carlson match uh this has started to become more popular by of playing the knight in the center Knight D5 e D5 and now the Knight comes to E7 C3 played by Arjun interesting move and Knight to F5 by pred A4 played here very important so that when A6 is played the Knight goes back and you have the pawn already on A4 Bishop E7 and now the bishop is developed on D3 so you can clearly sense the Dynamics of this game white has a queen side majority here while black has a king side majority majority he goes short castles and Arjun will be looking to mobilize this majority while PR will be looking to play in the center Knight H4 very interesting move keeping the Knight here aiming to go F5 and F4 is played A6 kicking the Knight away and now the Knight goes back to A3 the Knight will be very useful on the C4 Square for now Alexander takes on F4 and now the bishop will take the pawn on F4 if somehow PR manages to get this position with his pieces on E5 it will be pretty good so Arjun here instead of moving the bishop gives up his light Square Bishop takes on G6 and now H takes G6 is played Knight to C4 and queen C7 attacking the Knight on C4 if Arjun manages to get the pawn to A5 and the Knight to B6 he would clam down the position so B6 is played in order to stop that but white Black's position does look a bit Suspect with all these pieces Bishop E3 nice move thereby Arjun hitting the B 6 Pawn Rook B8 to protect it and now the bishop moves to the center with Bishop D4 Bishop G5 I really like this move by Alexander he's played this on a good Square looking at this strong diagonal Knight comes back to D2 Knight E4 could be an idea goes Rook E8 stopping that and I guess Arjun has to now figure out a way he goes C4 but notice how his dark squares have been weakened a bit and pred K plays this beautiful move Bishop E3 why is this so good because now after Bishop takes Bishop Rook takes you will see that the queen can actually move in here the bishop can go to F5 The Rook can go to E8 Black's position looks like really really well coordinated so Rook E1 by Arjun he says let me get rid of the uh the pesky Rook but Queen C5 is nice move he's looking at this diagonal King H1 played just moving the king to the side of the board and now Bishop comes out to F5 what is Arjun going to play he plays Knight to F3 now if Alexander doubles Arjun will play Queen D2 Rook D3 is the best move here but bg4 is a mistake that is a critical error here by Alexander because now after Queen takes E3 Arjun has has a very strong move and of course he finds it Queen D4 forcing the trade of Queens because the bishop is hanging and after Queen takes Queen Knight takes Queen the Knight is fantastically placed in the center and this end game can get very nasty now H4 is an interesting move but perhaps A5 becomes slightly tricky with the structure being locked and so Arjun himself plays A5 PR quickly pushes with the E5 pawn and so he takes and now Bishop takes on B5 now clearly you shouldn't take here because then Rook takes B5 and The Rook is very active on this Square so King comes to G1 oo you need to devel up your king in the end game Bishop D3 Rook can come to B4 Bishop can go to E4 attack this Pawn what is Arjun going to do he goes Rook A4 so if you go Bishop E4 there's Knight C6 at least so that way that stopped Rook E8 play played maybe not the most accurate move there what is arjun's plan now the A6 and D6 Pawn are week Rook B4 fantastic move he wants to come in and attack here a check to The King The King has to move up King F2 both players pretty low on time 15 minutes for Arjun 9 minutes for PR Rook e five attacking the D5 Pawn you need to defend it Knight goes to C6 now you can't take it because of the fork here and so rookie to check the King has to move where does the king go King F3 seems like the logical decision Arjun taking a bit of his time I don't know maybe he's confused between here and King G3 he goes King F3 and now Rook A2 not the best move because there is Rook B8 check and Knight B4 for King he goes for the check the king is a bit exposed here King at7 and now Knight B4 he can Fork there's Bishop E2 King E3 white would be better but he goes Rook d8 now Bishop F1 important move to hit here but he goes F5 which is maybe not the best takes on D6 fantastic Pawn is very strong but at the same time black also has his counter play now King F4 is a slightly risky but Arjun does it he wants to activate his King King activity is extremely important in the end game Rook takes G2 play now PRK wants to take these pawns and Rush these pawns down the board Arjun wants to rush his D Pawn down the board who's want to win here G5 check the pawns are coming forward Arjun moves in with his King awesome chess this is a fantastic game oh this is too greedy he had to go Rook E2 but Rook H2 because now Knight D4 the Knight shuts down the Rook from coming behind and also the E2 Square Rook A2 played don't push D6 Arjun because your A5 Pawn would fall and then there would be a Check Yes B4 first and you know you want to give up your Bishop for this Pawn but then white is winning so PR has to play along he has to go G4 Arjun pushes his Pawn forward G3 G Pawn versus D Pawn which Pawn is stronger D7 oh my goodness G2 coming up next Arjun is now going can he stop the pawn Rook h8 check fantastic move have to take it and now you make a queen with a check so Arjun has won the queen here he has a queen for a rook but is this position winning why is this so tough the reason why it's so tough is because the bishop on e4 is well positioned defending the pawn and The Rook can go to A1 threatening to make a queen so Queen G5 played Rook A1 now Arjun has to be very careful he goes Knight E2 stopping it but to make progress not so easy maybe Rook H1 is important or Rook D1 is important because the king should not be allowed to go near that's the only problem but Rook B1 is a big mistake by Alexander PR and Arjun finds it King E6 King moves in and now after Rook takes B4 look at this maneuver that Arjun plays first a check from the side of course King G6 is blunder because Knight F4 mate so he goes King G8 and now another classy move check to the king the reason for this check is to make way for the white king to enter here King F7 and this is exactly what arjun's going to do king F7 fantastic chess the king will find its home on f8 and it will be a powerful powerful attacker here Rook F7 and Arjun plays his King to f8 and with this prase position is going to collapse F4 he's moving his Pawn up Arjun gives a check to the king king goes to G6 now there are many ways to win here Queen G4 followed by picking up this Pawn with a check but he takes with the Knight and now after King F5 he can just simply chop the pawn off on G2 because that is a smart decision with Knight G2 if Bishop G2 there is Queen F2 check and you lose this and then eventually the A6 Pawn so G5 is played to attack the Queen the Knight moves up with the check and Alexander goes back to F6 Queen moves in with a check so Bishop G6 there is Knight D5 and so he goes King E5 but now he loses the G5 Pawn White is in the driver's seat King D4 and the queen comes back to F4 Rook B5 and King E7 played King D3 Knight to G4 and Bishop D5 white gives a check as well big tension here how is Arjun going to win this game he gives queen queen Knight King all working beautifully here and Arjun making use of all his pieces King also coming in if you play King takes A5 that's going to end in a mate pretty soon so he takes with the Rook but now Arjun finds this nice little check with the Knight King C4 and how are you going to finish this off yes Knight B2 King to B4 and in comes Queen D2 check yes that's over now the the King has to go to B5 and then King D5 is hanging and so PR resigns Arjun arigi scores his first win of the tournament gets to 50% one and half out of three but what a fantastic end game he played here absolutely Sublime and he can be on track now to score a victory in this tournament at least a huge boost of confidence for him as he played some fine chess in this game"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following

his game yesterday to Arjun arayi he played the Sicilian there will he try it again will he be in a fighting mood yes he is that's the kind of player Alexander PR is he's a fighter he wants to beat gkes Knight F3 we have the Sicilian now this is going to be exciting Knight C6 yesterday Arjun had gone D4 the open Sicilian will gukesh play that as well or will gukesh go for the rosol liimo he goes Bishop B5 it's the rosol liimo on the board and Alexander PR now plays the move E5 very interesting move this is becoming popular slowly at top level chess uh it must be mentioned that you can't take take and win this Pawn because of this queen D4 idea which is very common in Ru Lopez and Bishop E7 is not played often Bishop D6 is the main move this is something that pred has prepared for this game rookie won played and it has been only played in 14 games before so it's a new idea Knight jumps to D4 now look at this the Knight is at attacking the bishop here but it's risky chess because the black king is still in the center and gkes takes the Knight Pawn takes look at white he has development he's Rook here so he needs to open up the position black pieces are still not developed so C3 hitting open the position that's a nice little move if you take here that could mean a lot of trouble with D4 just energetic play so PR can't take it he goes goes Knight to F6 but again this is feeling so much risk because now after Pawn takes Pawn takes and pawn pushing to E5 he takes he takes on D4 and he takes back e takes D4 and now Pawn push to E5 would be an epic move but gkes goes D3 it's also very solid because E5 what Gish did not like so much is the fact that black was catching up in development like with D6 and so on so he therefore plays D3 and now castles he brings his Knight out to D2 so black has caught up in development a bit but what gkes is essentially trying now is to make sure that uh the D4 Pawn becomes weak Knight D7 nice move there by ped K but this Pawn is slightly weakened and gkes can go Knight to F3 to attack it yes he plays it Knight goes to F3 and now the queen comes to B6 defending the pawn and also attacking the bishop so you have to save your Bishop taking on taking the Knight may not be the best idea so he goes Bishop A4 and the Knight jumps to C5 now this Knight is attacking this bishop and of course taking this Pawn would be in correct as this is a double attack and you will lose a piece so Bishop C2 goes back and now PR K plays this nice move pinning so you will see that Black's position is a picture of Harmony now the bishop has come out the Knight is ready to sit in but gkes goes H3 and he says to predate do you want to give up your Bishop that would mean that I'm slightly better but if you don't give it up then I'm actually going for the D4 Pawn because now with with Bishop H5 gukesh can go G4 cut the bishop out exactly he does that he cuts the bishop out but more importantly now the Knight is free so Bishop G6 and now you can take this Pawn although it looks so dangerous but Gish needs to do it so he's now a pawn up he's a pawn up but pred has a very powerful move Knight E6 he finds it because if you take here F6 look at this Rook and the Queen on that so gukesh can't take it he goes back actually Knight F5 would have been slightly better but he goes back and pred plays Rook C8 maybe not the best better was Bishop C5 but okay Rook C8 played and now gkes needs to save his Bishop it's not attacked attacked but okay putting it on B3 makes a lot of sense now so Alexander what does he do next he goes Queen B5 and he's telling gukesh move your Pawn away so that my Bishop can start doing better so D4 played gues is a pawn up but now the bishop can actually settle down on e4 at the right moment this is a strategically very rich game and what is Alexander going to do next he attacks Bishop B4 played now you can go Bishop D2 here but gukesh goes very ambitious he plays his Rook up to E3 that's a good move he plays his Rook there and now the bishop no longer defends the F4 Square so the Knight jumps in and attacks this Pawn okay a logical move would be king H2 to defend it or Knight H4 to let the Rook defend it but look at this move Bishop D2 maybe not the best but gk's idea is so phenomenal he's actually giving up a pawn here with a check just notice this it's a check to the king so he's given back his Pawn but he just senses it that his King is going to a better Square Square he's playing with his King right in the middle game when there are all the pieces on the board Knight F4 check and now King G3 this is why gkes is such a powerful player he doesn't play like an engine he plays like a very very strong human and practical aspects of the game so now you see he really felt the harmony of the position that his King is here F4 F5 can come later A4 pushed an important move here for gkes A4 putting the queen away and now he can take the bishop he does it takes here Queen takes B4 and now he can chop off the pawn on D5 that's an important move to play yes he plays it he's now a pawn up and here pred has to go Rook fd8 but no he goes aggressive he goes Rook C2 wow he's trying to go aggressive there but B3 what a kamu saving the pawn also getting ready to put the bishop here on B3 and now Alexander in big trouble he goes Rook d8 attacking the bishop but the bishop can actually drop back now and white is ready to roll in the center so Alexander needs to be careful now what to do his position is quite tough but he takes the pawn he takes the pawn oh how was it hanging how is that pawn hanging can gukesh not take it look at gukesh adjusting himself in the chair he knows that this is now something that he can latch on to he's seen this it seems he's going to take the Knight he takes it and the point is now get it Rook D2 attacking the queen and the Knight so he plays Rook D2 and where is gkes going to move his Queen it's an important moment because you want to you can't defend this Knight anymore it's being attacked twice so can you move your queen to F3 oh he goes Queen E1 this is such a classy move now you can't take with this Rook it's it's pinned so you have to take with the other Rook but now the back rank is weak and gkes goes E6 wow what a move E6 there by the way a better move according to the engines was Rook A2 but E6 is so powerful you're threatening E7 and if you take Rook takes E6 Queen D6 by pred K not the best he should have sacrificed an exchange with Rook C4 but check now is just over King H3 and gkes moves his King to the side he pushes his Pawn to H5 but hey is that is that a mating threat because E7 is coming up simply he pushes his Pawn to E7 the pawn is about to Queen gkes is completely winning here PR who now takes here on G4 but this is all over because gkes is going to not only make a new Queen he's going to do so with a check and there's no real Attack that's coming in he makes a queen gives a check King at7 and that's a massive Advantage for gkes what a game this has been with gukesh playing all this creatively in complex positions Bishop takes F7 has been taken and now where does Alexander go he goes Queen F6 he's attacking oh he's attacking here and also threatening a mate is there a Twist here well I don't think so there's going to be Check Yes he takes on G6 with a check now if you take with the queen Queens are going to get traded so he goes King here King up just to keep this mating attack intact and gkes gives a check King takes bishop and now Rook E6 is it the move that gkes wants to play yes the queen is pinned and you're losing the queen and the game this is all over Alexander could very well resign here he would be down two queens after this but he gives a check King comes back maybe another check here on G4 yeah gives another check the king can run away to F1 and now after Rook takes F2 there is Queen takes F2 that can be taken yes he takes it Queen takes F2 and after Queen E6 well the thing is if you count the material this queen is extra here on eight for two pawns that's a huge huge material advantage gkes brings his Rook into the game attacks the queen and uh this has been a fine game for gkes with a check he's going to block it with his Rook Queen A6 check if you block with the queen maybe there are more checks with the Rook or the queen but after Rook E2 there are no more checks and it's time to call it a day for Alexander PR he's fought really well against both gukesh and Arjun in this tournament but he's lost to both of them and this might be a very very key game for gkes in this tournament because after this win he will join the leaders he will join the leader Hari Krishna on Two and a Half out of four and there you have the handshake resignation gukesh goes to plus one with three rounds to go he's in joint lead and this is going to be a very very exciting finish I I especially like this game for that King G2 King G3 idea of gkes which the engines do not prefer but from a human perspective it was just so good and gukesh later on in the press conference or postgame interview mentioned that he really like the harmony of his position with the King coming to G3 so that's what gukesh is uh all about he understands chess quite deeply beyond the engines and which is really cool to witness brings back all his pieces and we'll be ready for the next game thank you all for tuning in"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

game with 1 D4 now param has not had a great start to this tournament he has had two draws and one loss Sunan on the other hand has been amazing he has won a game has two draws and also gave a big scare to Leon aronian as well so this is going to be a very very interesting encounter maklu can he strike back with a win here we will wait and watch He's played his pawns up to D4 and C4 and San now plays his Pawn up to E6 are we going to see the Queen's Gambit declined here Knight comes out to F3 and Sunan now pushes his Pawn to D5 yes this is the Queen's Gambit decline territory G3 leads to the Catalan but I think param plays his Knight out to C3 and we have the Rosen on the board with Bishop B4 o this is going to be interesting because ragen is like this mixture of Queens Gambit declined and nimzo Indian he takes the pawn on D5 and also there's so much theory in this opening uh how can a top player like Parham outwit his opponent who's also 2700 GM Bishop F4 played he plays this line which is gaining popularity and prominence putting the bishop out to F4 earlier people used to prefer putting the bishop on G5 now look at this San has moved the same piece twice in the opening but with that he pinned here and now he brings his Knight out to C6 controlling the E5 square but Barham continues his development with E3 he wants to get his Bishop out then Castle it but here the game takes a drastic turn with G5 this is a typical idea in the Rago in you want to start hurling your kingside pawns and that's because you have this nice control in the center Bishop G3 played by Parham and now H5 is the very likely answer to this look at the time on the clock for param maklu 133 and Sunan is down to 1 hour 5 minutes so clearly Sunan is thinking while param is blitzing out his moves he's now moved to 134 that is just phenomenal he's so well prepared generally when you give up this bishop on G3 by the way look at Sun's time is he run down to 30 minutes on the clock or what this is already very very stressful he takes the Bish Bishop on G3 is's on 39 minutes so he's taken close to 25 minutes to make this decision generally this is not a good thing for white because you see you have got doubled pawns here also the E3 Pawn is isolated sort of backward Pawn but in return what param has got is that he's gotten rid of this amazing Knight on e4 and queen D6 now attacks the pawn on G3 by the way this same position not with Queen D6 but before that was reached between Magnus Carlson with white and Anish giri so this line is well known and look at param still blitzing out one hour 32 minutes wow insane and G4 played so the Knight is being kicked away from F3 until now San even though he's not in his prep is playing really well but now param goes in with his Knight Knight to B5 he's attacking the queen you notice how the queen uh when the king moved the Knight Knight's pin was gone so the Knight moves to B5 attacking the queen this queen can go back to d8 and E7 these are the two good squares here for the black queen we we'll see where the queen goes to here H Sunan thinking hard for his move not so sure where to play where to play his King meanwhile param is gone you know it's so intimidating when your opponent has a 1 hour time Advantage after just 13 moves so param you know these little things do matter a lot and would be making param feel really really confident here and where should you move the queen is the major question here I think sun gets ready for his move he plays it to E7 so this is fine now here kn5 is possible if you take the there is the for conon C7 so clearly Knight E5 is what everyone would expect but param still in his prep plays his Knight to E1 wow he's played his Knight to E1 this is a new idea he wants to go to D3 and sunnon takes here that's too simplistic a move for it to be good this was not a good idea because now baram gets the bishop pair Queen E1 nice move there and even even though the King right now looks exposed imagine if it goes to the H2 Square how safe would it be it would be insanely safe Bishop F5 played nicely developing and also getting ready for a queenside castle perhaps Rook comes to C5 and this time param does take around 10 minutes to make this move and long Castle is played this is risky because at some point a sacrifice can happen on C6 and then you can lose the A7 Pawn but for now param brings his Knight back and what Sunan essentially saying is that if I can get counterplay on the king side like with E3 or bring my queen here on the king I may not have to worry about my king so much Bishop comes to E4 and this is now uh very interesting Barham goes with his Bishop to B5 and attacks the Knight now this Knight has to move but where exactly ah Knight B8 that was Sugo's idea the Knight is his King's best friend and now param takes on e4 he has a 43 minute time Advantage Queen takes E4 has been played and now Queen A5 played there's a mate threatened here and here they can be a pawn Fork but then Bishop A6 check is very very uh uncomfortable and that's the reason why C6 has been played by Sugo he plays his Pawn up but this bishop is not really hanging you can bring your Rook out that can be an idea he oh he just snaps the pawn there on a7s param is like show me your compensation here San and San says I'm bringing my rook in if I can give a check here and then pick up this Pawn that could mean something but Rook C3 that's a nice move because after a check the king will Rush away to this safe hideout on H2 Queen goes back to E7 and maybe it's time to double up on the C file everything looks pretty well set oh he goes King G1 even before bringing his Rook out he wants to park his King on the H2 Square rookie six played here and he's attacking the E3 Pawn H will you give that up or what will you do oh he goes Bishop D3 and his point is if you play Rook takes E3 then there is Bishop F5 and already it's kind of uncomfortable oh he takes it he takes the Pawn San says show me show me what you've got and param says I've got nothing really I'm just going to put my king to safety bring my Rook to F1 attack here my queen is here my Rook is here you all tied up you are in trouble my friend Rook D6 played by Sunan and baram look at him just eyeing the board trying for some way to get in here what is White's move going to be now he plays his Rook to F1 and he sacks here because already Bishop F5 was becoming such a big threat so sunon sacrifices an exchange but param quietly takes it he's unperturbed the thing is now he's not just having a positional Advantage Pam has a big big material advantage he's an exchange up and this is just very easy for a player of his caliber he brings his Queen back to A3 and uh this is fantastic game here by param first showing great open prep then showing some brilliant moves Rook D2 the way in which he will convert this I feel is that he's going to take advantage of the f file that that's where all the weaknesses are F6 is played and now the Rook comes up to F5 attacking the H Pawn The Rook comes to E3 attacking the queen here and now the queen Moves In to D6 Knight comes to D7 and uh maybe Rook takes D5 is what's going to be play he plays his Rook to C2 he plays his Rook to C2 and maybe now take the pawn on D5 is the idea oh Rook comes to E1 maybe small counterplay here with Queen E3 and queen G1 no he takes on D5 there's no Queen e3 coming in because D7 is hanging and so this is all but over now the queen cannot move the Knight moves out to B6 Square attacking The Rook on C on D5 and Rook C5 played now Rook takes C6 Pawn takes C6 Rook takes C6 is going to be a check mate that's going to happen on the king side there and I think Sunan does not have any any counterplay here Parham has played a fantastic game not given any counterplay to his opponent and this King on H2 is a great great representation of how good the position is a shake of hands there sonan resigns param maklu scores his first win of the Chennai Grand Masters 2023 very very important Victory there for param and I think with this he makes a strong claim to coming back in the tournament he talks about Bishop takes E1 to be not a good idea he says you should have moved your Bishop back and the Arbiter comes in and says there's an analysis room you can go and analyze there and there you have it param already had it all prepared that you should move the bishop back Knight comes to D3 and so on yeah this was high class opening prep and I think putting some fine attention to perham's opening prep

a player like Pam who's always fighting for the full point so it's going to be a fighting game of chess that's for sure Knight F6 and now will param play E4 because that's known as the mckas scal variation he goes Knight F3 so just develops his Knight out and I think it's time to strike in the center with D5 that's what Arjun does and if Parham plays D4 we will be in Queen's Gambit decline territory so he does play it so we are now in the main lines of the Queen's Gambit declined Bishop E7 Bishop B4 these are the options he goes C6 the semis slav is on the board with C6 and param goes for the fighting weapon with Bishop G5 in these lines white sacrifices his Pawn on C4 and tries to uh get Center control meanwhile black tries to cling onto the pawn and say that I have extra material so that leads to very very fighting games A4 played now the main move here is E4 but A4 is played and Arjun goes B5 the point is after take take Knight B5 there's Queen B6 and a lot of theory but param avoids all of that he tells Arjun that I want to play some something totally new totally different which is going to throw you off guard but Arjun is not perturbed he says thank you so much param for the extra Pawn bolsters his entire structure on the queen side and now he's a pawn up but meanwhile param has castled himself and is getting a lot of activity here so fine play Here by uh param but Arjun also catching up he gets his Bishop out param has to prove his compensation and he does so by bringing in his Knight now look at this bishop Unleashed here and there's pressure on the B5 Pawn because of that but Arjun just ignores it and castles it out it's very interesting what he's done he's ready to give up yes ab5 now you can't take cb5 otherwise you'll simply lose the bishop so a pawn takes back and now after Rook takes Rook Bishop takes Rook this is what going to happen yes take Bishop takes I think Arjun is fine with the fact that Knight takes Pawn takes and Bishop A8 this position he's happy to play with the black pieces so let's see what param does no he doesn't take the pawn here he in fact goes Queen A1 trying to enter here on the queen side Arjun sacks ooh he doesn't give up the bishop he just takes the pawn he's like if you take here I'm taking the Knight on E5 this very sharp play by Arjun arigi and he's also calculated it very well so param now oh he sacks his Knight on F7 what a game we are having between these two fighters because the bishop was hanging and the Knight was also hanging so param sacks the Knight there this is known as Desperado and he takes with the king so that when the queen takes here the Knight will remain defended by The Rook that's why he's taken with the king and to tell you the truth the position does look very dangerous for black but you know when you have to win with black pieces you have to take these chances for now black is a pawn up um but the king does look a bit exposed meanwhile the white king looks pretty safe Arjun very calmly brings his Queen back his idea is to maybe put the bishop on C5 and put pressure here param now plays this very weird move Queen A1 it's slightly passive because the queen was doing quite an interesting job here on A8 was stopping Knight D7 because the C6 Pawn was hanging and now Arjun confidently brings the Knight out so yeah this is not working out so well he goes Queen B1 and his point is to keep an eye on the H7 Pawn here the position is settling down a bit arjun's Advantage is growing because of the last couple of moves that param has played which are a little bit too soft in the position H6 now the bishop comes back to F4 now Arjun can actually play his Knight to D5 here and yes he plays it because if you take then the pawns become all together that's really a good Pawn structure it goes Knight E4 the Knight comes to the center of the board and now is looking at these squares Knight comes to F6 very interesting and he plays Bishop E5 so now the E5 square look at White's pieces close to the king the queen always looking to enter somewhere here but uh Arjun now makes a nice move getting his Rook to the Central File Bishop H3 Parham is looking at the E6 Pawn weakness if he can reach there that's what he wants and Arjun plays his Pawn to C5 getting his Queen side majority rolling and also defending the pawn with his Queen the Knight goes back and param has seen that the E5 square is weak so he's rerouting his Knight to F3 Arjun immediately takes control of the E5 Square for the time being the queen cannot enter Because the bishop is hanging so you need to first save the Bishop he goes with the Knight and he's like if you take here I'll take back with a check so that's the reason why you cannot take the bishop for now uh Arjun plays the bishop to F6 even further controlling the E5 Square I think it must be taken on F6 the bishop yes he takes Bishop takes F6 and now you can take with the King you can take with the Knight you can take with this Knight let's see what Arjun does he takes with the Knight 5 F6 so that the E5 square is kept under control and also now there's no H7 Square accessible to the queen so Queen C2 played the idea is Rook A1 to come in here these are the two open files and both players are fighting for it Arjun here plays Queen A5 good move taking control of the a file if you play Rook D1 he wants to go Knight E8 and Knight f8 and fight for the dile so param goes Rook C1 this is a slightly confusing move why would you put your Rook on C1 is the question um not so sure here and Arjun now starts getting active he goes G5 he's not worried about the weaknesses around his King he thinks he can tuck the King on G7 and keep playing now G4 could be a threat the bishop has to move ooh Rook F1 that that's again a weird move by param I think he's losing the thread of the game completely he has just 8 minutes and this is not looking pretty for him Arjun now I think Queen A4 seems very likely yes he plays it good move there because if you take the queen ba this is better for black in all ways so that's the reason why he goes Queen D2 but now actually Arjun can play G4 earlier he could not have done that because after Bishop takes Knight takes the queen would have entered to H7 but here that's not the case he plays his Pawn to G4 and although the H6 Pawn would hang yeah he takes on G4 now the H6 Pawn will be defended by the Knight Knight takes black is simply a piece up it seems yes the king looks exposed but there's not really much happening H3 played and now the the Knight will come back to F6 another key point is that if you go for a check here I'll just take it and I have two knights which are really powerful and the king is safe so he takes the pawn on H6 here uh and Arjun now needs to solidify his position does so with Rook G8 very nice move bringing the Rook to defend the black king and now the queen will move into C2 G4 played with the idea of G5 maybe some some still some threats there but Queen C2 is such a nice move classy move there by Arjun arigi and he's attacking the E2 Pawn he goes Queen F4 yeah now the threat is G5 perhaps so King E7 he just shifts his King away controlling all the key squares and queen goes back to G3 somehow param is trying to do something in this position that will help his cause but Arjun is now on a greedy mode he's taken the B2 pawn and look at these three pawns they are so powerful Rook comes to D1 idea is to use the queen and Rook together but these two knights of black are so so good friends of each other they just defend uh everything that is there Queen takes Pawn that's chopped off and uh this is almost over Queen check King goes to F7 you can see Arjun playing so confidently so strong the Knight is hanging now so you need to save it he brings his King in and now here there is a finishing move Knight takes Pawn but it's so difficult to calculate because Queen takes Knight is and in generally in such winning position positions you don't want to make such calculations but that's the thing about Arjun he's able to just calculate cold bloodly Knight G5 check okay what happens if you take with the Rook he takes here he's already seen it Queen takes Pawn uh Queen takes Knight and now the king can actually move up the board look at Arjun just making his final calculations he doesn't want to watch this up he was winning against aronian as well but in the end the game ended in a draw here he plays King F6 and now after check maybe King F5 and the game is over because another check and the Knight will block it yes King F5 and if there any checks here Knight will block with a counter check and Parham resigns that is a great win here for Arjun which puts him half a point behind the leader of the tournament gkes and still in with a chance for a joint first that's what is possible but what a fighting win by Arjun after having not such a great game yesterday against aronian coming with black pieces and fighting and I love how maklu is also analyzing with Arjun just trying to uh understand what was going on uh in spite of losing the game maklu a true true student of the game wants to discuss what just happened and nothing but respect for both these players such amazing Fighters they actually Elevate the level of this game by their Fighting Chess a pleasure to have them at the

Yu yangi this is going to be a very exciting game Yu yangi looks very very serious he's thinking about what opening he should be trying against Magnus but Magnus has other things to worry about as well he's adjusting his pieces he's on 12 points out of 16 the leader is r on 12 and in the background we see Daniel dubov taking on Fabiano Karana the tournament is very exciting let's see how Magnus Carlson faces this challenge because Yu yangi is an excellent Blitz player off we go Magnus opens the game with 1 E4 we have E5 and the Petro Magnus quickly takes the pawn and pet is a very solid opening but very quickly Magnus plays hed3 now this is such a rare move if let's say this position has been reached 75 ,000 times this has been played only 25 times that's how rare it is and Magnus is literally blitzing out his moves Yu yangi can now Retreat his Knight to F6 which is a normal square but he goes back to D6 which has put Magnus under some thought now you can normally play your Pawn up and then bring your Bishop out and castle and that would be normal play but Magnus needs to play for a win here in such a symmetrical position how does he do that he goes C4 very interesting because if Yu yangi takes here he can take back get his Bishop out and castle that's his plan so taking the pawn might not be the best idea although it's a very normal move you can see Yu yangi is a little bit uncertain in this new position because he hasn't prepared it at home that's what Magnus wants to do he's telling his opponent that we both will play on equal terms in terms of theory and then I'm the superior player by the way Yu yangi has taken a very very dangerous decision he's given up a pawn but essentially he's telling Magnus that your pawns are doubled and I think I'll get them back later with interest and then your D3 Pawn would be weak okay black castles Magnus brings his Knight Magnus is like I'm not going to let go of that pawn now that's a very very precious Pawn that I have won in the center of the board how does black continue what is his plan to recover this Pawn Yu yangi has to answer these questions he goes B5 answering them he wants to push the Knight he wants to bring his Bishop here the other Knight here and then win this Pawn that's what he wants to do Magnus Carlson now has to fight against these things he goes A3 Bishop comes out and D4 I really like this move because now you are attacking this Pawn twice also you want to get the bishop out to D3 Yu yangi saves that pawn bishop D3 looks like a normal move but Magnus goes Bishop E2 Knight comes out and he PL PLS his Knight on E5 of course you can't take it because that would UND double the pawns and also you're looking at the softened C6 Square so Yu yangi must remain very careful because if he goes Knight B6 then the bishop comes here defends it also prepares the Knight jumping into the C6 square and so he's taking his time look at the time difference he goes Bishop F6 here now with Bishop F6 the point is you are attacking the Knight on E5 but Magnus can now jump into the Knight look at the time Magnus had 2 minutes 20 seconds now you have to take this Knight so you take it pawn takes now this Knight is attacked so you defend it now here let's say Magnus castles then he would come Knight F5 attacking here by the way these are the thoughts that are going in magnus's head right now he's thinking about that you push the pawn he takes your knight Pawn takes Knight takes now you will see that he's recovered the pawn and also attacking here but in comes this beautiful move and if you take here I have Queen C2 double attacking these two knights wow this is an amazing variation but look at the time Magnus has taken already he has actually taught here for close to a minute because he's unable to decide whether he should play this move he has to look 10 moves ahead if he wants to make that move Knight C6 that's the huge question can he play it he's now down to 1 minute 20 seconds that's not normal in a Blitz game that you're thinking for more than 70 seconds oh my God and he goes for it he goes for the variation that we just analyzed now this Knight has to be taken you can't tolerate such a knight on C6 it's a monstrous piece you have to chop it off Yu yangi is now thinking now look Magnus thought for one move for like 70 seconds but Yu yangi is going to bleed on every single move so even though Magnus is behind on time he will catch up Knight B6 he castles he has these moves prepared he castles it out and Yu yangi plays Knight F5 now if you play Bishop E3 that won't be great so he pushes his Pawn he pushes his Pawn forward and as we know these two pawns are extremely strong so you must take and take the pawn on D5 that's why what you have to do but you could also take on C3 Pawn takes C3 Queen takes D5 by the way didn't we tell you that magnus's decision of thinking for more time would work out look at that he has 16 more seconds than y yangi now Knight D5 this final piece where you play Bishop F3 so that you give up this Pawn that's such a smart idea you can also go Bishop G4 Magnus pauses here because he has these two great options in the position will will he play one of those or will he go and save the pawn which is also possible he goes Bishop F3 brilliant chess Knight takes C3 is met with Queen C2 attacking and double attacking so you can't do that Yu yangi has to move his Knight away and look at how the position has beautifully opened up for the bishop Magnus is an artist who has actually made the canas in his favor now Bishop F4 attacking here this is a critical Pawn because you take the queen and then supported by this bishop this C Pawn would become a monster so Yu yangi needs to save it maybe Rook C8 but that looks terrible he goes back but now you take and if I take with the pawn pawn pushes attacks the queen and I win The Rook so you need to be careful over there by Yu yangi I think Magnus can chop off the Knight but also he can let it be he can just bring his Rook to the open file why to take he can bring his Queen up that's also a good move but he takes it he wants Clarity so so now the queen has to take yes he takes Queen takes Pawn takes and now Rook D1 attacking here maybe a better move was to play something else but Rook D1 looks so normal if you play Rook fd8 there is C7 attacking this Rook so you need to bring this Rook to d8 and he brings it he brings this Rook to d8 if C7 you can go back and try to win this Pawn but now Magnus is next few moves are simply phenomenal he's going to you know this Knight is so much hindering these pawns he needs to do something about it pawn to D5 A4 sacks a pawn you don't want to be taking with this Pawn because then the B file opens up so he takes C4 what a move what a move you can't take here Knight hangs so he takes with the D Pawn Rook takes Rook takes and pawn pushes forward if you play Rook C8 I have Rook D1 with a back rank problem so Rook f8 Bishop comes in what Chess By Magnus Carlson because if Knight here Rook takes A6 and then Rook A8 making a queen on the board so Pawn pushes forward actually Yu yangi sacrifices an entire Rook because he thinks there's a chance that he can actually Queen his pawns if he pushes B4 he pushes because now if you take Rook takes A4 then C2 B3 B2 are winning here actually it's a draw so Magnus can't take the Knight he has 18 seconds to figure out Yu yangi down to 3 seconds Bishop F5 such a good move holding this dagal Knight goes back but now Magnus attacks the Knight there's simply no way to now hold this position together and look at how quickly Magnus gets his King in Pawn pushes forward but the king is just in time Yu yangi is gone here the king is on time he shakes his head but Magnus has played brilliant chess what a game of chess this this was by Magnus Carlson in Blitz chess he managed to create an absolute Masterpiece it's just 180 seconds right 3 minute game from that he thinks for 70 seconds for a move and then he finds these Amazing Ideas and manages to beat a strong player like Yu yangi and what does Magnus do next after getting up he wants to see what H what's happening on other boards he first goes to Fabby versus dubo board but the most important board is that of vladislav timv how is he doing because timv is his biggest trial he's half a point ahead he sees him fighting against Duda he assesses the position and then moves out from the door where generally only he goes outside you know the other players go to the Players Lounge while Magnus goes to his own private Lounge so he moves from here the team of nrk follows him because there is a live broadcast going on in entire of Norway Magnus has to move very quickly because if he walks slowly there are people out there who want his autograph so he moves very fast and there you see Raj jaabo on the right just sitting there and then Magnus has to move towards his private Lounge moving across all the players Yu yangi there H he jumps through of course I'm not going to try that but let's hear what Magus had to say about this game after the tournament but I really loved the game with Yu yangi I mean the the this idea of Rook D4 C4 sorry first A4 then C4 and you played it without much thought like you played it with once I mean that was insane um yeah it's quite typical though that when you have there far Advanced uh passp that yeah you just have to um to do everything um in order to uh in order to push it forward and besides he hadn't made it LO for his King which always like tells you that there may be um uh there may be chances for for tactics um but um I I think the thing I was most happy about in that game was early on um when um I I thought for a long time like longer than you usually should think and and Blitz and I needed some time to evaluate the position with um Knight C6 right yeah Knight C6 and the position we eventually get with uh two Bishops against two knights cuz at first my thought was well that can't be any good um his Knights are his Knights are active and my pawns are weak but I realized after a while that it was a lot more interesting for white than than I I thought at first um so I was happy with that then later I made a bit of a rash decision to exchange the bishop for the Knight um cuz I'd only counted on him exchanging the Queens when I thought basically um oh never mind I had C7 after otherwise yeah Bishop D6 C C7 yeah never mind that no but Queen C7 Bishop eight would that be compensation yeah some compensation but still much better for white yeah okay never mind I I was thinking during the game that he missed a chance by not taking cd6 um um cuz yeah then my intuition was right that of course that's why I had Queen takes D6 in my mind yeah anyway after that it was um it was all like move by move tactics but a what are you doing I'm on Wilder a why you being so nice to me I'm on Wilder a why should someone be on Wilder I on Wilder [Music]"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

"welcome everyone to day two of world Blitz 2023 we have the former World Blitz Champion mvl taking on Magnus Carlson mvl arrives early puts his jacket on the chair takes his seat there and as he starts to adjust his pieces he looks at someone calls him and then covers the camera some in inside joke there Magnus Carson arrives shakes hands there it's an important game because you want to start off day two well Magnus takes a sip of water and he'll now adjust his pieces that's what he always does that's his routine and now the players are ready to take on each other and but before that they have some jokes to crack about what happened against Neo and du both I was thinking about the one with we make so those who are very interesting jokes and we have Alina doret skaya the CEO adviser of Freedom holding making the first move and there she makes the first move for the players Freedom holding has been supporting these tournaments as you can see as a sponsor and that's why she's there and now the game is about to begin let's get it cracking mvl with the white pieces plays 1 E4 Magnus plays the Sicilian Knight C6 and mvl pauses for a bit because he can play the rosol limo if he wants but he decides to play the open Sicilian takes Pawn takes and the Knight comes out white also develops the Knight we have the sches nikov on the board Knight to B5 Magnus pushes his pawn and now Bishop G5 used to be played a lot but these days Knight D5 is in the rage takes and Knight comes back now the main move here is C4 that's played in many many games but mvl pauses once again for a few seconds and plays a four which is quite logical because when the Knight is pushed away you want to play the Knight back and then use your pawns to expand on the queen side that's where black has the majority you can see that Magnus is not very well prepared so he pauses for a bit to know what will he do exactly he brings his Knight out to G6 and mvl now can develop his Bishops Bishop E2 Bishop E3 it's normal position but he makes a tricky move A5 it's very important to kick the Knight away but Magnus makes an error as early as move 10 Bishop E3 what a powerful move you can see both the pieces attacking here and if you push the pawn there's Bishop B6 attacking the queen and then Knight C7 look at magnus's face he's so upset that he's made this opening error very very uncanny and that is that does not happen with Magnus offer he's just lost a pawn which is very very diff difficult now to recover he castles it out and hopes that mvl takes this with a knight so that he can get his Bishop out and gain some time but mvl now takes with the bishop because he can gain a Tempo with Bishop B6 at the right time Bishop D7 he comes back with the bishop and now Queen comes to C8 in this position if you look carefully white is a pawn up but black has some compens compensation with Pawn running down white can play the bishop up and try to Castle but there's also a very very powerful move let's see if mvl can find it you see the queen here is very very weirdly positioned so if in case you can find a way to attack it that would be something you can see mvl is about to make his move he's at 2 minutes on the clock Magnus has 2 minutes 20 seconds and he plays it what a beautiful move he wants to go Rook C3 and attack the queen and if the queen moves Knight C7 and trap The Rook Magnus knows the power of this move and look at these squares they are all covered beautifully what a nice move Rook A3 it's like you have the advantage but you want a winning position you're turning the screws Magnus takes Bishop takes and wants to trade off one of the Bishops well generally when your material down you don't want to trade pieces but here Magnus is doing that because white not only has the material Edge but also is completely better positionally so he tries to trade mvl takes it and if you take with the queen I would protect my Pawn with Queen D2 so he takes with the rook and now important to play C4 uh B4 here stopping Queen from coming here but an inaccuracy by mvl and now can Magnus find Queen C5 because it hits the bishop the pawn and also this Pawn yes he finds it pawn comes forward and now if Queen D2 is there white is in control but look at this move by Magnus attacking B2 attacking A5 all of a sudden he's got counterplay you can see magnus's body language is changing he's feeling that he's back in the game and also look at the time even though Magnus made a mistake in the opening he still 30 seconds ahead on the clock that's what Magnus does now mvl slides his Queen to the side of the board to defend both B2 and A5 but the Knight jumps in it wants to give a check and then move to the Central Square so he stops it with rookie one Magnus goes in Queen D2 in fact Knight D5 would have been much better to get back the pawn but Queen D2 is such a tempting move cuz you want to give a check and go here meanwhile the queen keeps an eye here also on the A5 Pawn which is the white piece that's not playing in the game it's the king if you play King F1 to stop Knight E2 and he finds it that's an amazing move it's an excellent move also Knight D3 is impossible because Rook E2 wins material so King F1 is such a classy move by mvl to find it under pressure is not easy but you can Bank on mvl to find these moves after all he's one of the best Blitz players in the world E4 is a mistake can ml find Queen C1 to trade Queens off yes he does again the queen cannot move away because the Knight would be hanging and so Magnus takes Rook takes Knight D3 now C1 and B2 are hanging you can defend it with Rook C2 or Rook B1 but mvl chops off the exchange what an intuitive decision mvl literally feels that these this queen Side Pawn fanks with the bishop is giving him a winning position and he made this decision in a matter of seconds that's the understanding these players have Rook takes D3 and now white has two pawns and a bishop but more importantly black has no counterplay look at this bishop controlling the open file Square on E8 that's why Magnus plays Rook E7 he doesn't want the king to come into the game but mvl knows what's to be done next he needs his King into the game and he would do that even if it meant exchanging the Rooks I'm sure he'll go Rook E3 to make way for the king to come up on the board yes he does Rook E3 fantastic move and now if the king can come nicely into the Central Square you can start pushing your pawns that's what he does King comes in Magnus is suffocated here he doesn't have space he needs to get some play Rolling that's why he has pushed his F Pawn takes the Rook mvl takes back with the Pawn King comes to the queen side hoping that it can save some of something here or create some play here with F4 but look at white pawns they are moving and Magnus gets really desperate pushes his Pawn to F4 well one of the ways is just to take and push your Pawn to E4 and then E5 coming in next mvl pushes it directly he pushes his Pawn to E4 big threat now take on D6 Pawn pushing to E5 Magnus is completely busted only thing that can help him is his time he has 15 50 seconds while mvl is down to 15 seconds somehow even though mvl has low time the way he's playing the confidence with which he's making his moves makes one believe that he's not going to blunder here meanwhile Magnus seems a bit hopeless in this position he pushes his pawn and now mvl takes it Rook F4 the idea is to pin this Pawn so that after cd6 there's no E5 mvl look at your time you're down to 9 seconds you need to make a move come on he pushes his a pawn Magnus takes it Bishop takes happens Pawn comes up to G5 and now B Pawn pushes forward W look at that the pawn is going here Magnus pushes his G Pawn down the board and MV simply ignores it he pushes his B Pawn he has full faith in his B Pawn but has Magnus got in some counter playay here with ponk pawn and then he has his own passer when well the good news for first check King takes Pawn takes Pawn mv's good news is that his Bishop controls the queening square so Pawn check King comes to D7 another check King comes up and now check here King comes up and the B and the D pawns are going to end the game d Pawn pushes forward two pawns on the seventh Rank and now black also has a Pawn on the seventh rank but the Bishop's going to sacrifice itself for the pawn meanwhile the king is coming up to Sheffer one of the pawns to the queening square Magnus tries a last last ditch attempt and the bishop comes back it's game over here Magnus Carlson resigns what a game by mvl Magnus made one error and he latched onto it like a boss [Music] he"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

the previous game against mvl and also against Sara he had lost the last time at World Blitz let's see how he FES this time we have the Sicilian on the board Magnus goes for Knight C3 not playing D4 he's waiting for that move moves his Bishop out Pawn comes out to A6 sarana wanting to keep the game in naidorf territory let's say if Magnus plays D4 we are back in naidorf So Magnus takes his time to decide what he wants to play here he can stop the expansion with A4 he can also play D4 and transpose back to the main lines or he can castle that's what he does he castles it out and sarana pushes his Pawn to B5 slightly risky strategy because if you look at white he's developed all his pieces has castled while black is undeveloped Magnus now opens up the position Sara takes and now Magnus thinks there's one idea to take with the queen but also very interesting move is Knight to D5 sacrificing the pawn because if you take here this is real danger with white having huge lead in development so move like Knight D5 in such positions is normal and Magnus I think was thinking about it Bishop f F3 very important move you don't put your Pawn on F3 here because that's a very passive way to play you play Bishop F3 because now in such positions you have ideas of pushing your Pawn forward so the Knight comes to D7 and Magnus hits on this expanded Queen side here which will give him some play fantastic chess here by Magnus Carlson now one way to continue for black is to push the pawn to B4 but then after Knight D5 it's a good position for white so sarana takes the pawn and now Magnus can take back with the Rook he does so The Rook is well placed the A6 Pawn is slightly weakened look at White's development it's looking good Sara must put his Knight on E5 no he goes E6 which is a mistake and what a quickly played move by Magnus hitting the bishop now if you notice the bishop does not have any squares to go to and the moment you defend the bishop let's say by Queen C7 I just sack sack and push my Pawn opening up this bishop so it's a very difficult move to meet Magnus has played Rook B4 even if you play Rook V8 I will sack sack and push my Pawn so big trouble here for Alexis sarana here magnus's idea of activating his Rook from A4 to B4 has worked like a charm and now Alex sarana in big trouble keep this idea in mind the bishop on B7 is running out of squares now what should Sara do here another idea is to move his Knight to C5 to defend the bishop because if you can kick the Rook away later on his position should be completely fine but it's impossible to do that because Magnus is going to sacrifice his Rook he goes Knight C5 and this is a mistake let's see how quickly Magnus wraps his brain around this calculation so you take Knight takes you push the Pawn you attack this Knight and this Knight now one move is Knight D5 because you block it but after I take take and push my Pawn the king is right in the center you can see the development is terrible the knights are beautifully placed the Rook is coming up the queen is coming in here so by this calculation I think Magnus can already think about sacrificing on B7 but it's easier said than done and Magnus has taken more than 45 seconds to work this thing out not at all easy but he's running low on time 1 minute 23 seconds left he takes it pushes the pawn pawn takes a check here so sarana was also ready but this inter medzo seems to have thrown him off guard he has two ideas one is King E7 other is Knight going back now if you play King E7 you have to be careful the bishop can come out from here and Checkmate you so there are two possibilities Alexi using his time well here to think what is the best way King E7 seems like the better option and after you take on B7 take here take here take here it can get very complicated and after Queen F3 white is better look at the black's pieces terribly positioned and so that's the reason why sarana must decide whether he needs to move his King up or not that is the big question here well he goes Knight D7 Magnus sacks another Knight takes check and now if you play G6 Queen takes E5 notice this is pinned and I attack the rook and the pawn so playing this might not be possible G6 he goes King up if you go Bishop G5 check trying to win the Queen the Knight blocks because now there's no pin this side what a complicated position for the time being Magnus is an entire Rook down so he must be careful he has 1 minute 12 seconds he takes the Knight now he's exchanged down he attacks The Rook Rook B8 your Bishop is hanging you really want to go Bishop G5 but Knight F6 Saves the Day for black so how do you continue here Rook D1 played very interesting if you take here Bishop G5 check is the smart thing to do he goes Queen C7 and now the bishop is hanging on B7 and the Knight is ready to come here next move if the queen moves away the king moves out the bishop comes out and then black could be an exchange up so Magnus has to take this carefully he takes the pawn Knight comes in and it's time to pin it Bishop G5 now he comes back with the queen and suddenly Black's position is much much okay you know it's no longer that bad Knight E4 but Magnus has shifted from an attacking uh way of dealing with this position to a more positional approach all he's saying is that hey look at my two Bishops and my two outside passers and I should be able to convert this without having to go into any tactical sequence takes here Queen takes and now sarana is basically saying hey look my Rooks are connected so in a way sarana has improved his position drastically Rook comes into B4 Queen goes back Black's position has begun coordinating but at the same time Magnus Carlson's pawns have started to move forward Rook goes to A4 the bishop comes back and now this very classy move pinning on the first rank this has limited The Bishop's movement and it seems like black has fought back into the game I like magnus's last move G3 because look at his presence of mind he just simply improves first doesn't trade the rook and now improves his King position with King G2 so that there are no checks on the last rank this will come into big use later on Queen goes to D7 doubling on the dile pawn moves forward Sara wants to keep his King in the center the game is now very interesting and exciting look at that quickly played move Queen B5 how does Sara find such moves in just like one second that's a question to me Magnus has 30 seconds now to work out what to do his Bishop can't move because his Rook is hanging and if the Rook cannot move because the bishop is hanging this is already trouble he goes G4 Bishop G5 mistake takes he gives a check is it a mistake in fact Black's position looks completely fine he can take it back with the bishop or the pawn he takes with the pawn Rook takes it's equal material now take the pawn on B2 no he comes in that's a blunder check now if the king moves it's a m so in Comes This Fork Rook had to go back and it's game over from an equal position in just two moves Alexi Sara blundered and Magnus took the full advantage of it there he is shaking his head he played the opening very well but Sara fought back and in the end Magnus tricked him when he was down on time I'm on Wilder and we are going to revolutionize how social media [Music] works"},

Magnus Carlson at the top Board of the world Blitz championships 2023 bat is waiting for Magnus to arrive he has the black pieces and there you have the world number one coming in shaking hands and getting ready for the battle up ahead parat has been in phenomenal form reaching here he's already beaten Zen Chong Shang Jawa adiban razen Sev Rak sadani and Alexi sarana back to back so Magnus has to be careful against the this youngster he already has beaten him once in classical Chess at the Qatar Masters let's see how this one goes he opens with 1 B3 wow Magnus going for slightly offbeat opening but bat didn't even blink you know he was ready with his response capturing the center he brings out another Pawn in the center Magnus plays E3 three and if you see carefully both of magnus's pieces are controlling the E5 Square the Knight comes out to C6 and you will see Knight defends the E5 Square so Magnus actually wants to take out that Knight very interesting opening Choice by Magnus bat on the other hand is playing very classical chess he's controlling the center he's telling Magnus give me the bishop pair for Magnus I think it's a decision between retreating his bishop or just taking the Knight he takes it and then puts his Knight on E5 Square bat says you can take it but if you do my Rook will come up so Pawn comes up to D3 to bring the Knight out and now Pawn to E6 Knight comes out white is ahead in development but black has the bishop pair and the center control so if bat can manage to finish his development he would be doing very well he plays his Bishop to E7 one idea here can be to play conservatively which is to take and then play Queen E2 and go for the E4 break in that way you will be putting your pawns on the light squares and the bishop is on dark squares but Magnus goes for the more ambitious approach he pushes his F Pawn and brings his Rook up he wants to get his Rook here eventually getting his Queen into the attacking Zone that's his idea here for bat it's a question what to do one idea could be to Pres the bishop but it looks a bit passive the other one can be to exchange these Knights but then you're unleashing the bishop and The Rook can come here although Knight D7 is a fantastic move later on you can play F6 and blunt the bishop on B2 but bhat is taking a lot of time if you see the clock Magnus has 2 minutes 40 seconds oh but he pushes his Pawn to D4 and this is a very good decision just ask the bishop on B2 how it feels about this pawn and it's not at all happy mag now pushes his Pawn to E4 so he's got Center control here but the bishop is blocked it's terribly placed on B2 what does bat do next he goes B5 he's trying to angle in for the C4 break which is a good idea Pawn comes up to A4 to try and create play from the queen side here that's the idea that Magnus is going for if he can take take and then get his Rook to the seventh he would love it meanwhile there's nothing wrong with bat's position it's only his time he's almost a minute behind on the clock but he's finding brilliant moves look at this move if you take I bring my knight here looking at these two squares so fantastic Chess By bat subramanyam although his time situation is not great his position on the board is fantastic now for Magnus if he pushes his Pawn to F5 it releases the tension in the center so he brings his Bishop first to C1 one of the things that we've always learned from Magnus is that you never let any of your pieces be in bad positions and that is exactly what Magnus has done this bishop can later be activated on this diagonal bat has to decide what's the next plan he's coming up with he goes Knight D7 which is a good move if Magnus does push his Pawn to F5 then the bishop comes on this diagonal so black would be doing very well even for Magnus it's not so easy to figure out what his next move should be pushing is not good taking is not good because the Knight takes he plays Knight to F1 yes the Knight is going to G3 but it allows black to push the pawn to C4 and that's exactly what bat does Pawn takes Pawn takes and few exchanges have happened and the Knight has come to G3 so essentially what Magnus is saying is that now I have a bishop here a knight here and a rook here so I'm trying for an attack meanwhile bat has a minute Less on the clock he goes G6 while this does stop the knight from jumping here it does create dark squar weaknesses in the position Magnus goes into his typical thinking pose he brings his Knight back to E2 putting pressure on the D4 Pawn maybe that becomes slightly weak after F takes E5 that's his idea bat goes Queen C 7 I love this move because he's angling on the C file Pawn to F5 this is a dangerous dangerous move that Magnus has played both for himself and also for his opponent on one hand he's trying to launch an attack on the other now black center is super solid and also he can triple down the C file which can become very very dangerous bat but down to 35 seconds bat needs to play quickly what is he doing Rook C8 well it's not easy to play against Magnus Carlson in a 3-minute game because Magnus comes up with his ideas very quickly and he gets his Rook to the seventh rank well done Barat and now Magnus brings his Rook back which means it's a small admission of defeat there on the king side bat goes Queen C6 he's trying to get to the D3 square with his Knight jumping in his only problem is this F7 Pawn that can become weak but everything apart from that looks good knight comes to G3 and he goes Queen B5 is attacking there on the D3 square but Queen comes and defends this and attacks here you can't take the bishop because F7 hangs and then E7 is also hanging but look at bat's time he's down to 15 seconds will he be able to survive Queen B3 good move the queen now defends here even if you attack the queen I can simply drop back also the bishop is hanging so Magnus has to take care of of that the only good point for Magnus here is his time it's very good time situation bat plays a very solidifying move just bringing the queen in defending everything in his position the Knight is terribly unhappy here on G3 because it's dominated by this G6 Pawn how do you activate the Knight that is a question also Magnus can go Rook A7 but then the Knight will jump here and attack the D3 Pawn not so easy you can see Magnus taking his time to figure out what to do in this position he's now going down to 49 seconds as well bat still has 17 seconds so now only 30 seconds difference H3 played bat tries to attack the pawn on D3 Magnus asks The Rook to get away The Rook goes to C2 again will Magnus repeat I don't think so he goes King H1 this is a nice move the Knight can go to G1 to F3 the Knight would love to be on the F3 Square meanwhile bat down to 8 seconds he plays Knight C5 the best move in the position Rook comes to A7 but nothing is attacked you can actually oh Rook A2 what a beautiful move by Barat he gets rid of magnus's active Rook on A7 you can see Magnus is really not happy with the last move that bat played it was a fantastic move that bat found with just 3 seconds on the clock and he quickly chops off The Rook now his position looking beautiful because this Pawn is safe D3 is a weakness Magnus down to 20 seconds can bat actually cause an upset here can he beat Magnus Carlson Magnus down to 12 seconds he brings this bishop back beautiful move he cannot take because then the F7 Pawn hangs and Magnus wants to shift the bishop there to B4 finds another excellent move gets rid of that dangerous Knight puts his Knight on G1 and brings this queen here look at how Magnus is coordinating now Bishop E7 to F6 is the best he goes Rook C8 E5 Pawn is hanging it needs to be defended Barett down on time he pushes his F Pawn blunders his G pawn and it's all over Knight comes to G5 Queen is attacked and F6 spawn is hanging you can see Barat is unhappy with how that thing ended right at the end it was not great but look at Magnus there telling him good game of course a great fight by bat subramanyam there who matched Magnus move for move and a great gesture by Magnus Carlson you know motivating the youngster after the game he knows what these youngsters can gain from his few good words fantastic game I'm on Wilder and we are going to revolutionize how social media [Music] works

playing against each other in over theboard play Magnus opens with E4 we have the Sicilian Knight to F3 and pawn comes up to D6 is nihal going to play the nidorf let's see Magnus plays the open Sicilian Pawn takes Pawn Knight takes and the Knight comes out to F6 attacking the pawn Magnus defends it and yes we have the nidorf and Magnus plays Rook G1 a very interesting move the idea is to play G4 but you know you don't really move your Rooks like this in the opening this is a line that has been played before quite some time but it's not as popular Knight C6 played by nihal he plays right in the center and that's a good way to continue Magnus goes G4 now it's a pawn sacrifice but it shouldn't be taken because take take Knight takes his met with Knight D5 and if you take with the bishop there is take take check here and Bishop B5 so all these tactics need to be known and of course Magnus knows them G6 that's why was played by nihal pawn moves up to G5 and now nihal has to move his Knight he goes to H5 magnus's opening has worked out pretty decently as ni has spent 30 seconds for the first 10 moves he goes Bishop G7 and now Magnus can attack the Knight on H5 he can also play Queen D2 and prepare long castling Nial has opted for this dragon type setup with his Bishop on G7 putting pressure right in the center and Magnus goes Bishop E2 he's attacking this Knight Here and Now nihal has some decisions to make where is his Knight going well one way to continue here is to take Bishop takes and then push your Pawn to E5 and that would be very interesting look at this line take take take uh instead of taking E5 Bishop goes back and then bringing your knight to F4 and black seems to have a decent position but right now nihal is thinking and he's down to 1 minute 54 seconds well he takes that's a good decision Bishop takes and now you should play E5 no but he takes here this is not a good idea he does play E5 and his idea is now to plon the Knight on F4 but Magnus has a brilliant move here which is to play Queen B4 now why is the queen so much better here it puts pressure on D6 It prepares long castle and then it also puts pressure on B7 so instead of coming back to D2 Queen on B4 is what Magnus needs to find and he finds it of course he's going to find it he is the best player in the world queen B4 is an excellent move Nial now brings his Knight in but Magnus says I'm going to Long Castle how are you defending this Pawn playing King E7 is not at all a good idea just play Bishop C4 so nihal has some very big concrete issues to solve this is problematic also Knight takes E2 is just met with Knight taking back so big big issues here also TimeWise nihal down to 1 minute 20 seconds you can see Magnus feeling that he has the advantage and that he can bring this full point home what should nihal do here he's known as the master trickster he needs to trick the best player in the world right now will he be able to do it well he brings his Bishop out and now Magnus should take the pawn this is a very nice juicy pawn and after Queen E7 comes this beautiful move Queen C5 attacking the E5 Pawn which is not at all easy to defend so taking there is a good idea but no Magnus blunders he plays Bishop G4 now this is actually a very smart move because Magnus did not want this bishop here so after take take he sees no way that this Pawn can be defended so that's his plan but nihal has a brilliant move here which is Queen takes pawn and putting a pressure here if you take the bishop and attack my queen I give double check and take your queen this is all very complicated calculation because after you take the queen he takes the queen will nihal be able to find Queen takes G5 is down to 34 seconds he needs to make his move he's calculating well this is his chance and with 26 seconds left nihal makes the decision he takes the pawn what a move by Nial seren and you can see Magnus Carlson freezing there he hadn't seen this move he thought he would simply take the bishop and there's no good Discovery but now he's begun to calculate he shaking his head there he's unhappy nihal serin back in the game look at his Focus there he knows that he has managed to trick Magnus Carlson what an interesting move Queen G5 now what does Magnus do well he doesn't have too many options if he takes the pawn here black will simply castle and if he takes here there is Knight D3 check but he needs to find something in that variation so Bishop takes Bishop I give a double check here then you move the king I take your queen you take the Rook you take the queen I take the bishop you take the pawn well it's some five six moves deep calculation which Magnus can of course do it I mean he's he can do such calculations but I don't think he's happy anymore because the opening worked like a charm for him and suddenly nihal is back he takes the bishop on E6 nihal gives the check King goes to one Nial picks up the queen Magnus also takes it and now Rook takes and nihal very quickly castles Rook goes back defending this Pawn on F2 and now a mistake by nihal because Rook d8 now Rook B6 is possible attacking the Knight and the pawn instead Knight C6 was much better he finds it Knight comes back he takes the pawn Magnus still upon up but Nial gets his Rook to the seventh heaven now both his Rooks are beautifully po also the Knight is coming into the game so Nial is playing on compensation here he knows that he has the play Magnus comes Rook B6 good move attacking the Knight the Knight moves into the center of the board he takes the pawn here on A6 Magnus two pawns up Nial chops off another Pawn Rook takes C2 has been played and now Rook B6 played defending the pawn on B2 and now what does black do here is the question Magnus has an extra Pawn he's also planning to push his Pawn here so if you take Rook takes F2 then after I take take the a pawn is extremely strong so Nial goes Rook A8 his plan is that now you can go Rook B7 cutting the king off and white is better here later on you can start pushing your Edge Pawn down the board but Magnus down to 20 seconds Nial has 11 seconds what is Magnus Carlson going to play next is the question he goes A4 and Neal brings his King in very smart decision the the king will be well placed on the F6 Square just keeping control of the position but magnus's time look at it he's down to 98 Magnus needs to move he's taking too much time he's bit under pressure Kink moves up he takes the pawn on at7 but what is nihal going to do next brings The Rook here Knight comes here so now if you take the Knight I take your Rook so nihal brings this Rook away to the side he has 8 seconds Magnus has 6 seconds here he plays his Rook to at six putting pressure on the G6 Pawn Neal takes the Knight and now look at magnus's clock 3 2 1 oh he was almost going to lose on time and now we have a repetition incoming it seems because if he just does not repeat the Nial Rook will come in here and they will attack the B2 Pawn so Magnus agrees to a draw what a game that was Nial serin managing to hold his own against Magnus was epic both of them shaking his head and here Bishop G4 Magnus says he just didn't see that uh he should have just taken the pawn on D6 Bishop G4 wasn't a good idea and uh what a game that was and I really love how nihal and Magnus are analyzing after the game also Magnus has had great respect for nihal in general the hiter comes in and stops both of them from analyzing because the other games are going on and well the first ever over theboard encounter between Magnus and nihal ends in a draw and I'm sure nihal would be happy with the result because he was under pressure the entire game but as we know him the master trickster tricked the [Music]

where he's at the board and his opponent has not yet come and there he is Richard raport who's here and Magnus and raport have had some amazing games in the past filled with excitement and Brilliance in fact the game in 2022 World Blitz was so so phenomenal it was something that Magnus said was perhaps one of the most exciting games of Chess he had ever played will they be able to create the magic again raport has the black pieces Magnus has white rapot adjusts all his pieces puts them on the right squares and we are ready to rock and roll what will be the move that Magnus will come up with and also it's a very important round because it's round number 19 out of 21 at the championship the player shake hands and E4 by Magnus and the French defense is on the board what will Magnus play he plays The Exchange variation a very smart call by Magnus for two reasons one is that he's leading in the tournament the second is that raport is known for his Dynamic and Brilliant play and Magnus wants to just play a simple position where he can make use of his own strength so H3 now he's taking Rapport out of theory he just plays a simple little move 97 raport puts his Knight here flexibly Magnus plays C4 C6 played by Richard just solidifying his Center Magnus brings his Knight out in effect the strategy that Magnus has used here is to play with an isolated Pawn because eventually black will take white will take and will be left with an isolated Queen Pawn in the center that's a positional disadvantage but but on the other hand you have more space raport takes the pawn on C4 Bishop takes on C4 and now brings his Knight here to D7 White Castles it out and the Knight jumps to B6 Bishop drops back now you can see black has both his Knights trained on the D5 square the square in front of the isolated Pawn is generally a weak Square so the Knight jumps in now the position is round about even maybe white has a very small Edge because of the space advantage stage very natural moves are to play Rook to E1 taking control of the open file also a move that can be played is Bishop G5 here trying to put pressure on the queen and provoking F6 because once you provoke that move oh he's played it then this entire diagonal gets a bit weak so F6 is played Magnus goes back with his Bishop raport brings his Bishop out to E6 and now the Rook comes to E1 rapot making use of the F6 move by bringing his Bishop back and nice little move attacking the bishop if the bishop moves the Knight jumps into the square so rookie 8 played and this already seems like a roundabout even position now one idea here is to play your knight to H4 and try to settle down on the F5 Square the other idea could be to bring your Rook to the other semi-open file but Magnus has to come up with something because you know you want to take this bishop but after Queen takes black is is very well coordinated so Magnus goes A4 and raport instantly responds with A5 this is a mistake why because now Magnus takes and you can see that there is a small little thing that has happened if raport takes naturally here suddenly this Pawn is hanging so raport Mo A5 was a little bit of a not so great idea very interesting how Magnus provoked that small little error Bishop H5 played now you can chop this Pawn because after Bishop F3 you can take here and there's this spin the Knight cannot take back so it's a great idea there but Magnus doesn't want to do that he moves his Knight away to H4 Rook comes to E8 attacking the Queen the queen moves back to C1 big problems here for Richard raport especially with this Pawn on A5 if he tries to defend it with here Knight B4 impossible there's a pin here he cannot move the Knight this F6 provoking was a great idea by Magnus suddenly has to decide what to do well one idea is to move his Rook back to A8 and defend but that is such a sad move right you don't want to really play your Rook back but what else he does it he defends the pawn and now Magnus can go back to Queen E1 but then he'll come back Rook E8 so Magnus plays his Knight F F5 Queen goes back to D7 attacking the Knight now the Knight is hanging if you move it back the bishop goes back black is under control then Magnus has 1 minute 30 seconds raport has 1 minute 57 what a move here by Magnus Carlson bringing his Queen to C5 you might wonder what if I just simply take the Knight well then Queen takes B6 the Knight is pinned here cannot take the Queen the queen has to go back defending here and then I can take Bishop takes Pawn takes and Bishop A5 Pawn up for white but this is good drawing chances for black this is exactly what Richard raport should be doing here pick up this Knight on F5 but he's taking a lot of time he's now down on time as compared to Magnus he's trying to calculate it out all carefully there's also a very interesting move Knight takes Pawn because then after you take here then you take this and the Knight is gone here you have won this Pawn so that could be an idea to take on A4 there's so many little nuances that you are thinking about here and that's the reason why Richard raport is taking all his time which is not so good because he's now taking taken close to a minute on the clock for this move finally he moves his King to h8 which is a mistake because now white has two powerful moves G4 attacking the bishop and defending the Knight and bringing the Knight back to G3 attacking this Knight let's see what Magnus chooses here he can play both these moves to save his Knight he's moving the Knight he brings it back good move there the bishop is attacked and now don't forget that this Pawn is also hanging this has been some great great positional play by Magnus Carlson of course the bishop has to be moved there's no other option what to be done you know you have to move your Bishop back to F7 or G6 these are the possible squares he goes back to F7 and now Magnus chops off the pawn a very clean Pawn up Knight goes back to C it and now Magnus has his beautiful idea give a check Bishop goes back and now bring the Rook here trying to enter here and the point being that if you take here and I go in you try to defend I take take and Checkmate is happening so can Magnus actually find this queen f8 and Rook E1 that would be a very powerful move he has 53 seconds to work it out but there are other moves as well he can simply drop back the bishop and he would be a pawn up a simple Pawn up right now the threat is B6 to win a piece so Magnus needs to move his Bishop out from there but what is he going to do is the question actually B6 is not really a threat as as well because then the queen can always give a check Magnus brings his Rook smart move if you go B6 then there's a check and then the Rook jumps in so clearly that cannot be done the Knight has to be moved away so that the Rook can control this last rank 27 seconds for Richard raport 32 seconds for Magnus Carlson he brings his Knight to D6 Magnus now must move his Bishop away or what else he can play Bishop D2 this is a nice little move he plays Bishop B4 attacking the Knight on D6 but the bishop can be chopped off here will Richard play that with 15 seconds close to that left he takes on B4 Queen takes B4 and now another pair of minor pieces are traded the net result is that black is a pawn down a clear Pawn down but you can hope for a draw but Magnus goes Queen E6 trading Queens because if you take Rook takes the Knight is attacked so is the pawn so you can't trade Queens he keeps the Queens on the board but now Magnus takes on B5 Pawn takes Richard down to 10 seconds Pawn takes if the Knight has to now join in the game Knight F5 Knight H5 Knight E4 there are a few possibilities there you can also push your Pawn forward he goes Knight E4 now the knights need to be traded where does the Black Knight go can you go to C4 but then the White Knight will jump to C5 so he takes on e4 which is a nice little move takes here the D Pawn is very very powerful but at the same time if you push now to D5 then Rook A1 check and Rook D1 that's why G3 beautifully played there by Magnus a check comes in King moves up and now Rook D1 he stopped the D Pawn from moving but Queen C6 if you take the pawn there's Rook E8 check to win the queen so King moves up to X7 down to 4 seconds Magnus has 10 seconds he comes back creates a discovered attack saves his Rook Now The Rook is going to move here and give a check there but he plays F5 he takes takes and queen C2 pins the pawn what a beautiful Chess By Magnus Carlson he's now two pawns up Queen moves to B3 he also has 16 seconds Duke and Bank on Magnus Carlson to convert this position in his sleep he's so good at end games he starts pushing his spawn raport brings this King in King E8 and now very good technique look if you play D7 the king is going to block that pawn forever so you don't want to really block that he goes Queen E2 and with that he's going to keep his Queen active Queen moves in a check another check King goes up and now the B2 Pawn is hanging Magnus plays H4 trying to make a square for his King but now raport takes here does he have a draw here that can be made because his B Pawn also looks very strong but the D Pawn is super fast it's about to Queen Magnus Carlson there is so nervous he's so tensed but he's also knows that he's so close to Victory Queen F6 attacking this Pawn here also defending the pawn from queening Magnus gives a check King goes to B5 and now King comes in to defend the F3 Pawn there's no check because now there is this and so Queen A1 mag makes another queen a check on G1 King comes up and guys this king is safe it's going to run away Magnus Carlson wins the game shakes his head there what a game by these two players always exciting but one can really sense how Magnus Carson managed to play so so well in the middle game a joke there by m raport brings a smile on the face of both the players and fantastic chess Blitz chess by both of them [Music] [Music]"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

Magnus Carlson taking on Sergey gregorians Magnus of course with a rating of 2887 the best player on the planet gregorians a strong Grand Master From Russia who now represents Hungary and he has achieved quite a bit he has a rating of 2532 is clearly a big difference between Magnus and him in strength we'll see if that manages to manifest in this game Magnus opens the game with E4 gregorians go solid with E5 Knight comes out and we have the ru Lopez with Bishop B5 A6 kicking the bishop the bishop moves back and now what does gregorians do Knight F6 is the most natural move you bring your knight out and he does that Magnus plays D3 a very solid system in the Royal Lopez just wanting a normal game trying to get his bearings into the tournament first rounds are always a bit stressful for everyone Bishop comes out to C5 so more active development there Magnus pushes his Pawn to C3 later on the D4 break can be quite a potent one B5 pushing the bishop the bishop comes back on this beautiful diagonal what I do not like so much is gregorians taking a lot of time for his moves but he's just trying to ease into the game Bishop G5 played by Magnus pinning the Knight Here and Now black needs to decide what exactly to do pushing the bishop away is a logical thing to do Magnus keeps the pin on the bishop G5 is possible and with that move the game can get very sharp Gregorian down to 2 minutes 10 seconds Magnus still about 3 minutes he's showing his confidence not just through his moves but also his handling of the clock Bishop goes back to B6 the position is completely fine for black right now now Magnus has to think he doesn't Castle he doesn't put his King here he plays Knight to D2 developing his Knight and gregorians now can go G5 he can even Castle in such positions it's not a big problem but he's thinking about what is the move that he would like to play he's taking his time there's another idea which is to put your Bishop on E6 there's also a possibility to play your queen to E7 he goes Bishop E6 a nice little move because if you take here black wants to take back with the F Pawn bolstering his center now Magnus must decide generally castles is the normal move and that is exactly what Magnus has done he's not afraid of black hurling his pawns down the board with G5 and gregorians with now Magnus having castled could also be interested in castling but look at the time difference he has 1 minute 20 seconds Magnus has 2 minutes 39 seconds that's a huge time difference it's also because gregorians I think feels over a by the situation not ready for it needs to keep moving it's only 11 moves that have been played but he's a little bit confused and I think this really puts Magnus in the driver's seat he's also very confident here so now castling by black position wise black is doing absolutely fine if you are white here you have a few few plans you can go Rook E1 Knight F1 that is exactly what Magnus does there's also another plan of playing A4 there's also another plan plan of playing H3 so there are many many different plans that are possible in this position Magnus chooses Rook E1 because the idea is to put your knight here and then use it to move ahead in this direction gregorians goes for a slightly dubious plan he wants to play his Rook to G8 and then later on push his Pawn to G5 when he doesn't have to worry about Knight takes G5 sacrifices interesting very interesting idea but maybe not the best so Magnus now takes his time and plays Pawn to A4 so with this move he's threatening to take and take the Rook so Gregorian moves his Rook to B8 in that way Magnus will get the open file and you will see that top players do this all the time they're playing first Rook E1 trying to play in the center then they suddenly play A4 playing on the other Wing they are playing on all sides of the board creating quite a lot of pressure when it becomes very diff difficult for their opponents to handle it now Magnus can take on B5 but he goes Knight F1 and Rook G8 this was the plan we were talking about that gregorians wants to do to play his Pawn to G5 but with the pawn moving here clearly the E3 square is a great jumping point to move to F5 which is weakened so now Magnus has to decide how to continue here Knight E3 looks like the normal way to do it just putting your knight on a good Square also there's this question whether you want these Bishops to be traded you know you can also drop back your Bishop to C2 and then unleash it on this diagonal with the move d4 so a lot of possibilities here Magnus now takes and the time difference has reduced look at magnus's time he has a minute Gregorian suddenly starting to get more confident he has 40 seconds Magnus has a minute and now he must trade the Bishops Queen D7 not a good idea because now what Magnus can do is drop his Bishop back yes he finds it and now D4 D5 is a massive threat so this entire concept of Queen D7 was not so good he should have traded the Bishops here gorian down to 25 seconds now needs to play his next move what is it going to be it's just 20 seconds Knight G4 played which is a fine move because with this if you trade the bishop comes here but I think Magnus is not going to trade he's going to keep more pieces on the board Knight D5 fantastic the bishop chops it off Pawn takes Knight drops back now the pawn is hanging but Magnus instantly plays D4 look at this bishop opening up with the queen coming up here and threatening a mate fantastic chess now gregorians in big big trouble here because his position is falling apart this bishop has also opened up on this diagonal he takes the pawn a very good idea now is to play Queen D3 Magnus takes here now Knight F6 has to be played so that black is in the game but he blunders with Knight G6 here and Magnus plays his Bishop to F5 with this the Knight is hanging instant resignation and the game ends in just 23 moves that was a big big surprise there in the end the position was still unclear after Knight F6 Magnus wins the game but that's the thing he put so much pressure on his opponent in the opening on the clock that in the end Sergey gregorians wasn't able to manage it and Magnus cson wins a what are you doing I'm un wielder a why you being so nice to me I'm un wielder a why should someone be on wielder I un [Music]

player who always gives Magnus Carson a tough time it's Yan sist of Duda he's on the left of your screen and he's facing Magnus Carlson at the world Blitz 2023 in usbekistan a key game 3 minutes plus 2 seconds increment Duda has the white pieces Magnus is black and off we go E4 by Duda E5 by Magnus very solid we have the ru Lopez On The Board A6 played here by Magnus Carlson and now Bishop goes back Knight comes out white castles Bishop E7 you are in the mainline theory of the ru Lopez is there going to be a marshall Well turns out Duda plays A4 the anti- Marshal system and then breaks in the center with D4 this is all well-known Theory and now Yan takes on E5 Pawn takes and now you put your knight on D2 this is generally how you play you avoid the queen trade Magnus puts is Bishop on C5 now the C4 square is a bit weak so the Knight has this beautiful square that it can sit on but on the other hand black has lot of space on the queen side H3 is played so that the Knight doesn't come here and hassle the pawn on F2 in general a useful move to play and now a good move is Knight to A5 but Magnus makes a slight error with Queen E7 now Bishop D5 would be very strong because if the Knight takes then Pawn takes opens up the rook's attack on the E5 Pawn but Duda plays A5 not Bishop D5 and what he's planning to do is fix this weakness on A6 and attack it meanwhile this A5 Pawn can also become a big weakness later on in the game we'll see which Pawn becomes the bigger of the two weaknesses at6 a useful move also made by Magnus just improving his his position stopping any white piece from going to G5 Queen comes up and now the Bishops are offered to trade black seems to have equalized out of the opening The Rook is coming to the defile and so right now Bishop takes Bishop takes with the queen and now how should white continue here should play the Queen on C4 no he goes Knight B3 very interesting move because what Duda wants is the C5 Square for his Knight so when the bishop goes back he trades the bishop in order to get this C5 Square which is an important Square for the Knight because it will not only attack the queen but also the pawn here on A6 but Magnus is okay he plays Rook F to d8 the position is very very interesting from the perspective of weaknesses C5 is a weak Square black queen can also come to C4 if five Pawn A6 Pawn all these pawns are a bit weak so a lot of things to play for both players also having quite a bit of time Duda has 2 minutes on the clock Magnus has 2 minutes 28 seconds what is Duda calculating here one of the things he might be calculating is the natural move to go Knight C5 because if Magnus comes Queen C4 now he can push the queen away with B3 and then the queen goes to B5 it's an important move to put the queen there but no Duda doesn't go for these lines he goes Queen E2 now with this move what he's telling Magnus is that I'm going Knight C5 you won't have the C4 square and then I will also attack the A6 Pawn twice so very interesting move here played by Duda but Magnus now plays a beautiful Moon Knight H5 he's coming in with his Knight he's going to attack the queen you can't play G3 to stop it because the H3 Pawn is hanging so Duda goes Knight C5 and he's expecting Magnus to move his Queen but Magnus moves in with his Knight wao this is attack for an attack there now the queen taken then I'll take your queen so he takes on E6 takes on E2 with a check if you take Rook E2 after F E6 black has the open file here so Duda doesn't want to really take the Knight on E2 the other option then is to come King F1 but Magnus is there with Knight G3 to double white pawns and now Black's pawns are also doubled so once again we have lot of imbalances in the position Black's pawns are doubled but so are whites E4 Pawn is isolated this Pawn on A5 now suddenly starts to become more weak than the A6 Pawn because the knights are differently placed White's Knight is not doing much while the Black Knight is attacking there also Rook B8 to B5 becomes a big plan the time on the clock 48 seconds for for Duda 2 minutes 11 seconds for Magnus the king comes up to F7 what is Duda going to do next now because the more pieces he trades the more difficult it might be for him to defend the A5 Pawn the E5 Pawn on the other hand can be defended by the king so this end game has suddenly become quite dangerous Magnus now chops off The Rook you take with the Rook now and King E7 just topping The Rook from entering now the A5 Pawn is hanging do you don't want to go Rook A1 but also if Knight takes then there's Knight E5 so pawn moves up to G4 Duda thinks his position is fine but look at the time on the clock and look at magnus's idea he wants to go Rook p8 defend his own pawn attack here a typical maneuver in such positions The Rook really settles down well on the B5 square is Duda going to lose the pawn he goes King E3 which is a useful move to play in general Magnus brings his Rook up Pawn to G five Magnus takes it Knight takes and now B3 played wao what a move there if you take I take with a check and then chop off your B2 Pawn because the A5 Pawn anyway is falling you know Magnus could have also taken the pawn on A5 now Rook C1 played so as to put pressure on the C7 Pawn that is duda's idea the position still dynamically equal but Magnus is putting the pressure he takes the pawn very important for Duda to play C4 but he blunders with Knight F3 and now Magnus has Knight C4 look at duda's time he has only 4 seconds he's shaking his head he's down to 2 seconds King E2 played it's like Duda has almost given up Pawn takes Pawn Rook takes and now Rook takes B2 you will see that black is two pawns up but white gets back one of the pawns so it's three versus four in night end game and generally that's good enough for the side with the extra Pawn to win in night end games also notice this a pawn is such a strong passer Magnus also has 1 minute 45 seconds Duda shaking his head he's unhappy with the way he has played but Duda is a fighter and you can see there he's kind of refreshed himself and said to himself I need to just fight I just need to give my best and I must make magnus's task as difficult as possible that's what he's doing and now King E3 if Knight D7 you can actually take your Duda but of course you can't calculate it all in that last time that pawn end game surprisingly is a draw now Magnus pushes his Pawn it's still equal because White's pieces and pawns are very well placed while Black's pieces and pawns are not so easy to advance King goes to F3 Knight comes out you can see that Magnus is going to use his amazing end game technique to put pressure on Duda he first is bringing his Knight to a better Square he brings it to F4 so that the Knight could come to G2 and attack this Pawn Duda has tarted that plan with King F3 he has 7 seconds on the clock it's amazing how Duda is maintaining his time on the clock now the Knight comes and blocks the pawn Magnus is trying to bring his Knight into the game the Knight goes to B4 if there's some way in which Magnus can dislodge the knight from C4 Square in order to promote his own pawns but it's not going to be easy he goes Knight C2 check and now brings his Knight to the center of the board Duda moves in ooh the C5 Pawn is hanging you can't save it with the King it's a check there what to do are you losing the pawn if you go Knight B3 then all of a sudden the king comes in that's also a trouble so he goes Knight F3 he goes after another Pawn check and now Duda is going to actually win the pawn on A6 for a second he'll be a pawn up from being pawned down but now Magnus has restored the material balance and this should be an easy draw now the only problem of course is that the Knight is going in and attacking this Pawn Duda plays his Knight to B8 maybe not the best idea and now Knight C5 will trap the Knight so he brings his Knight back with 1 second on the clock Magnus has won the pawn but still the position is drawn it's not easy to win but from a completely even position Duda has made a mistake which has given Magnus a chance he brings his King on the other side you can see the concentration on magnus's face Duda meanwhile still on 5 Seconds how is he managing to keep his nose with so many moves to make King comes up to F6 and Duda is not so happy but guys do you know this position is actually a draw Knight D4 but not when you have just 2 seconds that's so difficult to make all the accurate moves but he's doing it the Polish grandmas is making one good move after another and the Knight is coming to D5 not only to check but also to prevent the king from coming to the F4 Square how is is Magnus going to continue next pushing the pawn might not be a good idea so he keeps his Knight there Knight comes to D6 the king defends it and now black puts his Knight on F7 white is playing quickly look at duda's time now 7 Seconds Magnus down to 38 seconds insane King G5 he's improving the position of the king Knight comes to D6 attacking the E4 Pawn with a check Duda down to 4 seconds he needs to move he placs his King there but Magnus moves his King in now important to come back to D3 He makes a mistake with Knight D7 and now Magnus is winning Knight F7 brilliant move Knight F6 another important move don't push G5 that is Knight G4 with a draw so you need to play King H3 finds it again what a beautiful move King goes back and now it's time to start pushing your Pawn that's exactly what he does dudai is shaking his hand he knows that he's now messed it up he's actually going to lose his another Pawn Magnus is back he he there feels the relief of you know the way in which he was better and then the things turned around Duda fighting but now for sure black is winning with these two pawns and Magnus being very careful Duda resigns what a game that was between these two players hats off to yanof Duda for making so many moves with just couple of seconds on his clock and also to Magnus Carlson for absolutely not giving up right till the very end and fighting and winning this game that's why we call Magnus one of the greatest players of end games of all time I'm on Wilder and we are going to revolutionize how social media [Music] works"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the

prananda takes the white pieces against Vincent kimer it's going to be a big Clash prag has arrived at the board he has the white pieces and there you have Vincent coming in they both have played several games in fact their first Clash goes all the way back to World under 10 Championship now both of them have become two of the best players in the world with an ELO of 2747 Vincent with an ELO of 2738 this promises to be an exciting Clash the prag Masters is one of the biggest events in the world of Chess before the candidates and we have three Indian candidates playing there prag gkes and vidit because this proves to be an ideal place for them to get some playing practice before the big matchup there you have prag adjusting all his pieces that's a common thing with all of these players and Vincent comes back and now takes his chair let's go the game is about to begin it's 90 minutes for 40 moves and then 30 minutes increment with 30 seconds per move shake off hands and E4 is what prag says to the chief guest and he makes the move E4 on the board pictures to be taken and the games have begun oh BR takes it back he takes the pawn back but perhaps that's the move he wants to make or will he play something else Vincent starts the clock and prag takes his time generally prag has this habit of taking his time before the first move this is also something that vidit does before his move uh again it's something that they follow as a ritual to get into the zone to get into into that Peak mindset so that they can play their best possible chess and this is very interesting uh to know what he is doing but for now let's focus on the game because it's not so easy to know what prag is thinking and he opens the game with one E4 and presses the clock Vincent on the other hand takes absolutely no time and pushes his Pawn to E5 no meditation no calmness nothing he just like I'm ready with my move Knight to F3 I'm in the zone says Vincent Knight comes out to C6 and are we going to witness the Italian because prag really likes this opening Bishop C4 played and both of them have played so many games in this opening Knight F6 comes out there is the sharp line with Knight G5 but I doubt if this will happen a no it doesn't D3 the slow and steady way to play the Italian Bishop C5 comes out and now prag just castles the way in which white builds up this positions is to put his Pawn on C3 and then later play in the center so A6 played making a square for the bishop to drop back on A7 prag goes C3 and you will notice that Vincent isn't castling very quickly you know he's waiting for Pug's intentions he goes back with the bishop so that later on a pawn push to D4 will not hit the bishop Bishop is well placed A4 gaining space this is how the Italian is played both keep making useful moves PR keeps the option of playing Bishop G5 open he wants that black castles before maybe he pins it I don't know there are lot of little subtleties here you can play H3 he goes Rook E1 which is also a very useful move you can put your knight on A3 you can put your knight on D2 so a lot of things can happen here Vincent now castles and actually prag has this opportunity to pin the Knight but then H6 would come in so he instead goes H3 just improving his position stopping Knight G4 ideas so that the F2 Pawn will be under pressure and you know just gets up from the chair Vincent now uh plays Knight to H5 now this is a move that Vincent had played against volon before and prag is he prepared against this move yes he is he goes Bishop G5 now you would love to push your F Pawn but actually it's pinned so Vincent brings his Knight back and now this is such a provocative idea because prag would have done Bishop G5 without this provocation but now you've lost actually a move so prag decides to take advantage of it with D4 voltin had actually gone Knight D2 but with D4 four prag is hitting in the center making use of this pin at6 played by Vincent he needs to do something about the pin he cannot keep it for too long of course BR doesn't want to take the Knight on F6 he comes back to H4 keeping this pin intact and now uh Vincent is thinking does he go G5 who he plays it Bishop is attacked now Bishop can come back to G3 that is possible uh then you maybe go Rook E8 or queen E7 but I think BR can also sacrifice his Knight will he do it yes he does it he sacks his Knight he takes the pawn he's going to get two pawns Black's King is going to get completely ripped apart but Vincent calmly is drinking water he knows what is happening he has 1 hour 25 minutes on the clock PR by the way has 1 hour 30 minutes he takes on G5 and now PR takes back Bishop G 5 now important moment in the game because the threat is to go Queen F3 and then attack or maybe even just Rook E3 Rook G3 so Vincent needs to be careful with what he does but I believe that he is well wored with this he goes King H7 and that's a very useful move because he his idea is Rook G8 hitting the bishop and then putting the Rook on G6 to defend the Knight so that's the plan queen F3 played by prag excellent move hitting the Knight and attacking it twice so there's no time for Rook G8 King G6 King comes up O King is exposed but how do you attack because now White Center is falling apart Bishop H4 played now idea is to give a check perhaps but that's not U so dangerous because I go back and that's why Vincent takes the pawn in the center and he's saying that look not only have I taken the pawn I open up the E5 Square for my knight if you take back the pawn my Bishop comes to the life comes to life and defends the Knight so Vincent looking very confident prag gives a check for now it seems like prag is thinking a bit he has 1 hour 14 minutes but very much that he is still in his prep because if you are not in your prep you would take much more time than this for your every move that you're making King H7 how do you continue the attack is the billion dollar question here maybe you just want to get your knight out well prag goes Bishop G5 very smart move his idea is check and when the king comes here give another check and just Round Up This Knight on F6 so Vincent has the only move and he finds it Rook h8 because now after check King G7 there's no Queen at6 The Rook controls the square so very important move by Vincent the best move there and PR quietly and calmly plays Knight D2 this opens up a huge huge uh area now because the threat is E5 and Knight E4 so either Black Goes Knight E5 to stop this move or this very weird move Queen G8 oh Vincent finds it Queen G8 What a move because if you take here take here take here check opens up the bishop and this Knight is hanging what an interesting defense with Queen G8 he's actually broken the pin here you know the Knight is no longer pinned so next move he can actually move his Knight and if he gets Queen G6 King G8 then Vincent would be much much better prug attacks you know he realizes there's no time and if you now take this Pawn then after Rook takes E5 boom boom check this is game over and a beautiful variation is take take and Rook e one fi take this with the rook and it's a mating attack here anyway Vincent goes for the best move he finds Knight H5 he is well prepared here he attacks the queen on G3 Queen H4 prug goes and pins this Knight remember this prug is a piece down in the position so he needs to recover that Queen G6 played defending the Knight also the best move you really don't want to be going for G4 stuff because black simply moves his King away so good move there hitting the rook and saying to the king you can't escape just yet but isn't Vincent simply going to play his Rook to G8 and mate in one by the way look at the time on the clock while PR still has an hour Vincent is down to 28 minutes so he is L you know he might be well prepared but he's trying to recall his lines and this is never easy Queen G2 mate is threatened you go Bishop D5 once again prag in his prep still 1 Hour 1 minute still on the clock wow he defends the pawn and he's threatening Bishop F3 to attack the Knight Bishop F5 played fantastic move Vincent still making the best moves in the position and now prug goes Bishop F3 very important now to take here take here and then bring the Rook because then you have this bishop opened up on this diagonal but instead Vincent goes directly Rook A8 a mistake and this is a huge huge error because now prag has this move G3 which is fantastic and the point is I can take with the bishop there's no mate right now I want to take with the the bishop but there's mate and PR finds it G3 he's taken quite a lot of time in fact he took close to 30 minutes and he found the move G3 the point now is if you take here to open this up and attack the pawn I have Knight E4 which is a fantastic move so Vincent goes King H6 which is I think the final mistake of the game prug finds G4 now what an excellent move the threat is not to take this or this but the threat is G5 and then picking up the Knight with the bishop Pawn takes Pawn he attacks the center but now G5 is incoming isn't it oh but no G5 then there is Queen takes G5 perhaps and then in the end the Knight would hang so prug says I'm not even in a hurry I'm just taking back the pawn now my threat is G5 and Bishop H5 insane chess here Vincent Kim are down to 10 minutes on the in fact he's gone down to 2 minutes he's thinking a lot he takes the Knight he takes his Knight and picks up the pawn takes E5 but isn't this G5 coming in and it's game over G5 check PR thinking yes G5 and if you go with your king back Bishop takes H5 is just a killer blow and so now he has to play Queen takes G5 which is not the best not the most ideal yes he takes he gives up his Queen but but Vincent has some material you know he's not completely lost he has two pieces is and a pawn for the queen that's seven points against nine now an important move for prag is King H1 not King H2 oh but he goes King H2 this allows wincent the idea of Bishop G6 and then later on in many lines Knight G4 or Knight F3 comes with a check that's why King had to go on G1 uh H1 but he blunders he goes Knight G6 this is a mistake because now yes you attack the queen but the Rook is hanging and PR simply takes the Rook King takes and he's going to take another Rook here on E8 and this is game over yes prananda has won two Rooks for the queen and if you notice he's two exchanges up but most importantly his Rook is going to chop off these pawns later and the a pawn is a complete winner Vincent tries to create some play he goes Knight F4 he is angling at the H3 Pawn he's also attacking the F2 Pawn but truth be told prag doesn't care about those pawns because his focus is now on his a pawn that is the how do you call it the Million Dollar Baby there Bishop takes B7 and now you want to pick up this Pawn but maybe the best idea is to push yes that's what Vincent does he keeps for the time being this structure but can prag now start already bringing his kn Knight in he goes Rook eight which is a cool move it also forces the bishop to go to B6 because if you take on a F2 I simply take on A5 and my a pawn is a runner so he goes Bishop B6 and now it's time to bring your knight into the game somehow black has a lot of representation on the king side but on the queen side his Bishop is all alone trying to keep everything together that's not going to be enough prag is just easing into the game you can see the confidence on his his face Bishop takes F2 chopped off by Vincent the pawn is not so critical because there's no way that black is creating any play there Rook comes in and takes the pawn there are now several threats one of them being Bishop E4 to pin here you know the bishop so have to play this carefully he goes D5 very interesting move because if you take Bishop D5 maybe King H4 is his idea and trying for Bishop G3 and some kind of an attack but prug gives no such opportunity he goes Rook F1 so that if you take the Knight I take your Bishop attacking here and this is quite dangerous so Vincent drops his Bishop back to B6 uh the bishop was running out of squares there and now prag is simply going to take the bishop he's thinking hard and yes he does takes Pawn takes and now Rook B5 Rook B6 start pushing your a pawn down the board that's the idea yes he plays his Rook to B5 great move by prag there and Vincent he goes Bishop H3 well he just takes that pawn uh attacking The Rook but the Rook now can move away like Rook G1 check looks like a great move oh prug just sacrifices his exchange back he says that I don't need to keep so much material for myself I can just give up one of my Rooks to remove one of his attackers and now take the B Pawn and there you have it guys the a pawn is running down the board there's no way that Vincent's going to be able to stop it and he resigns there prananda wins what a big victory for him with this win prag gains five ELO points pumping up his ELO to 2752 becoming the India number one on the live ratings getting ahead of Vish Anand and also Crossing 2750 for the first time in his career Vincent there discussing with prag smiling they both are friends of each other and prag of course trying to sort of think what was happening were you guys prepared you know there were the I think this conversation is very very interesting between them and uh there you have Vincent saying I was trying to recollect everything prag also well they actually played 24 moves of preparation and after that one mistake by Vincent and the game was over what a game this was what a brilliant prep by both players but prag more so and for now he leads with one out of one in Prague"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an

one of the brightest youngsters D gukesh taking fort with the white pieces and he's facing Richard raport one of the most creative players in the world of Chess gkes comes to his board he adjusts himself he's wearing a Waka jacket the West Bridge uh is the company that sponsors him supports him and Richard raport is here right now Richard's rating is down to 2717 but at some point he was right up there 2770 2780 you know fantastic chess player and Shake of hands gukesh will begin and he starts off with 1 E4 what is raport going to play my guess is the Sicilian knowing that how aggressive raport is I think he would want to go for the throat raport takes his time and opens the game with the Sicilian very interesting because gkes also loves complex positions raport also loves them and it's Sicilian on the board so everything to fight for here Knight comes out to F3 and now Richard can go D6 Knight C6 E6 G6 there are many ways to play this Sicilian uh opening he goes D6 which is the main move GES has two approaches positional move with Bishop B5 or the main move with D4 and that's what he does the open Sicilian is on the board Pawn takes pawn and now Knight takes Pawn very likely so we are going to watch a open Sicilian game which could be theoretical and generally through this move order we see the nidorf happening Knight C3 and the knorf starts with the move A6 but Richard plays his Knight to C6 so the classical cilian is on the board and it's the most logical move on the board because you put your knight out you develop it but gkes goes for Bishop G5 this is known as the RoR Rouser variation inside the classical Bishop G5 and you want to quickly develop Queen D2 long castle and start pushing your F Pawn that's how the game goes Queen D2 is played by gkes meanwhile black is playing within his territory these moves Bishop D7 A6 E6 are very common in this system GES castles it out he is getting ready for a big fight here he brings his King to to C1 and Richard plays his Pawn to E6 black wants to go Bishop E7 later maybe Castle short maybe keep the king in the center maybe move the queen and Castle long so a lot of flexibility in Black's camp and gkes goes F3 now this is an important branching moment because F4 is also played often but gukesh goes for F3 line and his idea is that he wants to go G4 and H4 meanwhile Richard takes the Knight Queen takes on D4 and what is the next move that he wants to play will he go Bishop E7 just finishing his development yes he does Bishop E7 on the board now generally the D6 Pawn is soft but if you try and take it this way then there's always compensation you know with Bishop takes C3 or queen E7 so goues here plays this little move King B1 he puts his King to the side and raport goes Queen to C7 he knows that here there's no hurry to Castle his King is well placed in the center and gkes now comes back to D2 well one of his ideas could be to REM maneuver his Knight to the D4 square and B5 played so Richard is absolutely not uh worried about his king or anything he play play his Pawn to B5 gkes goes H4 from the time situation it does feel that both players are well prepared at this point of time and now Richard plays his Pawn to B4 the Knight is attacked but in a way the Knight was not doing much on C3 so gkes is happy to reroute it he plays his Knight to E2 from E2 it can go to D4 it can also go to G3 to H5 so a lot of possibilities there A5 played so black is actually playing very quickly wants to play A4 A3 or A4 B3 all of these possibilities exist wo goues goes for C4 and his point is if you go here and take it I have E5 fantastic move and if you take here then eventually your Bishop is hanging so that's the reason why you can't take the pawn E5 played here by raport trying to stop wh's E5 ideas but then he does weaken the D5 square and gk's Knight goes to G3 he's looking at this square but also looking to take and then put his Knight here notice that if you take on F6 at any point like here now raport will take with the bishop not with the pawn and if you try to win this Pawn then this is excellent compensation here for black Bishop E7 Bishop C5 King E7 so gkes not really tempted by taking the pawn he comes back Bishop E3 and he is ready to sort of start his Knight's Journey maybe to F5 but maybe to some other Square he goes H5 now Richard uh he wants to maybe keep the Knight away from this square or he wants to stop white from pushing his Pawn to H5 so in general a useful move to play and now gkes finishes his development he plays Bishop E2 so gk's idea is simple he will move his Bishop away take his Knight to F1 to E3 and then look at the D5 Square I understand that this is a very long maneuver because the Knight has come from C3 to E2 to G3 to F1 to E3 only to go back here but that is the most important Square in the position and that's what gkes is going for he goes Knight F1 and he is going for this plan with maybe bishop G5 maybe Knight E3 so Richard now plays his Bishop to E6 he is attacking the C4 Pawn but actually this Pawn is not so easy easy to take because there will be a pin here with Rook C1 so for the time being gkes plays his Bishop to F2 a small surprise for me because I thought he would go Bishop G5 and Knight E3 Knight D5 but Bishop F2 makes lot of sense he just wants to keep his Bishop raport goes Queen B7 actually black is lacking active plans here because if you push your pawns I'm simply going to go to B3 A3 and to A3 B3 so there's no way to open up the position meanwhile the Knight is coming in there are ideas of G4 so very very pleasant position for White rort Castles now this is actually playing with fire because if gukesh gets a successful G4 raport is in big big trouble but for the time being gkes simply improves his position very interesting move Bishop D3 because one could imagine that gkes would jump in with his Knight to the center of the board which was also a nice move but he goes Bishop D3 and and he is angling with his Bishop in this direction wow Rook comes in attacking the C4 Pawn um also improving the position of the Rook I think it's time to jump in with your knight that's exactly what gkes does the Knight jumps into D5 it has to go and raport takes it with his Bishop now you have both the options you can take here with the pawn when maybe black would go Bishop d8 Bishop B6 trying to trade his bad Bishop but KES goes Ed opening up the bishop and wanting to go all out on the attack with G4 this is excellent exciting chess Bishop f8 played by raport now is it time to just go for the attack with G4 because if you play it takes I can take and if you try to win a pawn here I simply blow away your king side this is what could happen and this is exactly what gkes has done he's played G4 rapot tries to create play on The Queen side with B3 but I think I think gukesh can simply keep it closed with A3 the game is getting very sharp and gkes seems to have the upper hand against Richard raport gkes thinks for a bit because you know he could go on an attack there but he first decides to defend his position plays his Pawn up to A3 what's next now for raport where does his play come from he goes E4 this is what top players do when they are pushed they try to create counterplay but there's an excellent move for GES to put his Bishop in the center of the board and he finds it Bishop D4 what an excellent move here he is now attacking this Knight because this is now trouble for raport he takes the pawn he takes the bishop with his pawn and now the Knight is going to fall the main problem here for black is that his King side is falling apart gh5 is a big threat and if you take here H5 just opens this m net so what is raport going to do how is he going to find play he goes Queen A6 he plays it but now can GES just take the pawn on H5 that would be very strong also gkes has 13 minutes on the clock raport has 16 minutes gukesh now takes it he takes the pawn and clearly Richard has to be careful one thing is that you can take this PA of course you don't want to take this that just leads to a mate after Queen G5 so he goes Queen takes C4 and he's threatening this check now a very strong move is King A1 because if you come here I can go Queen E3 but gukesh makes a bad move he takes the pawn on D3 and after this the position is just equal the thing is you don't want to trade the Queens here it was very important for GES to find this Mo King A1 so that if Queen C2 there's Queen E3 and if Queen takes D5 he can continue the attack with at G6 but once he took here now check King A1 this means that the queen will be traded and the worst seems to be over for Richard he takes on D3 Rook takes D3 and now pushes his Pawn to A4 notice that even though black is a pawn down these pawns are just amazing they are creating a back rank mating net against the white king and it's so difficult to get out of it and that means that gkes cannot really win here he he can actually he has to be a little careful about these backr issues like raport goes Rook C4 he's attacking the H4 Pawn he's also coming in with his Rook trying to launch a mating net on the back rank Bishop comes back to C3 for gkes and uh yeah makes sense because otherwise there could have been back rank problems raport takes the pawn pawn takes Pawn here and uh now F takes G6 you you can see that white is still a pawn up but uh uh it's nothing special because that extra Pawn is not so relevant here for because of the back rank problems that white has so here Rook takes G6 King comes to H7 and now I have to be careful for the back rank problem so maybe bringing the Rook back to G1 is the best move yes that's what he does and now I think raport can play his Rook to E8 to just come in to E1 and that could be his idea here no he goes Bishop H6 raport is a world class GM and he absolutely understands here that the worst is over gkes does take the open file here uh and tries to maybe create some kind of play with his Rook but raport puts his Rook to f8 and he is putting pressure on the F3 Pawn Rook comes in to E7 with a check and now the king can simply move away uh maybe to G8 yeah the G8 Square looks good you can also go up to G6 but yeah King G8 played and now there is a threat of again a back rank problem and so gukesh needs to actually come back with one of his Rooks which one is it going to be he goes rookie one back and there's no real way to make progress black has a very strong position there I think gukesh already seems to have offered a draw and raport accepts it and the players agree to a draw I think gkes mentions that somehow he should have gone Queen G5 instead of taking the pawn on D3 um and that was definitely def itely a great chance there but gukesh did miss his possibility to score a full point in this game raport has been a tough opponent for him he has had several losses he has also beaten him once but uh today he was very close to getting a very solid Edge against uh the Romanian GM but turns out that in the end raport once again wriggled out of the mess with some creative defense but a great game between these two players and looking forward to more exciting games from both gkes and Richard raport in this tournament when you have them players like these it is definitely very very interesting and exciting I am always uh quite uh amazed when the players analyze without a chess board at the end of the game these complex lines in blindfold but then for them it's quite normal okay than"}, {"instruction": "Generate a

facing him is param one of the best players in the world has lost a bit of rating recently and has come down to 2715 but on any given day he can beat just about anyone meanwhile prananda has this amazing streak going on at the time of playing this game he is the current India number one and he has a live rating of 2752 he gets the best game Award of yesterday and he is getting a small trophy there a small little uh you know cubicle there for his efforts his win against Vincent kimer a nice feeling before this crucial game there you have param arriving prag has an unbeaten streak of 47 games as he goes into this battle which is immense the Young is just so so solid and there we have making the first move is none other than five-time world champion Vish Anand who's the ambassador of this event he he's here to make the first move and he plays D4 for param what a nice feeling to you know have vishy open the game this very very important one shakes hands with both Prague and param and off we go now this is the second round of the prag Masters is param going to go D4 in the game as well or will he change his move Well turns out that param gets his Pawn back adjusts all his pieces and the thing about param is that he's very aggressive while Prague is more Universal in nature you know he can attack he can defend he he tries to be more accurate a handshake as we begin the round so it's basically a clash of styles baram opens the game with D4 presses the clock there what is PR's response going to be is he going to go for Knight F6 is he going to go D5 few possibilities here he goes Knight to F6 and now generally param would go C4 you know that's the main line but here he goes the London system with Bishop Bishop F4 trying for something new something creative and prag goes D5 now these days black players are very well prepared against the London because London is becoming one of the main lines E3 played Just cementing the position also keeping the Knight on G1 for now Bishop comes out to F5 prag wants to get his Bishop out and then play E6 okay the only downside of this move is that now the B7 Pawn is a little bit soft so white can quickly get the queen to B3 and put pressure here that's exactly what param does he pushes his Pawn to C4 and prag defends his center with E6 Queen B3 played attacking the B7 Pawn now the main move here is Knight C6 because after Queen takes B7 which is a mistake you have Knight B4 attacking here and black is already better so will pra go for Knight C6 which is the more combative approach here no he goes Knight bd7 which is not perhaps the best move but of course you can't take the pawn because after this take take and B2 this is a very good position for black so that's the reason why here param goes Knight to C3 and prag now has a lot of pressure in the center so he goes D take C4 he takes the pawn and allows param to develop his Bishop Bishop takes C4 at first sight it does feel like Black's position is slightly passive uh you know he has less space white has more space but after Knight to B6 you can see that trugs pieces are actually quite well positioned you know Bishop is outside the pawn chain this bishop is open Knights are looking into the center of the board so the bishop comes back to E2 and next move param will develop his Knight then simply C CLE bring his Rook to the center and so on prug plays the move A5 slightly interesting this uh move that prag has gone for he wants to remove the queen from the B3 square and Perham goes A3 well maybe he didn't like the fact that A4 A3 was possible directly and so A3 played and now prag goes C6 he puts his Pawn on this nice Square and it's a lot like the slow defense you know the position and now param goes Bishop G5 well Knight F3 was possible but somehow maybe he didn't like this he wanted his Bishop here to move from F4 he goes Bishop G5 prag plays Bishop E7 very simple and solid move and now o typical paramu F3 this is very ambitious the Knight on G1 asking why did I not why was I not level up to F3 and A4 fantastic move here by prananda it seems like black already has a very nice position out of the opening now you push H6 Bishop H4 and Knight D5 looking here that would be something but instead he goes Knight D7 and this move by frog is a very interesting choice because what he's doing is he's telling param that after your move F3 what I feel is that your dark squares have have become weak you know you're going to eventually play E4 so these squares become weak and if I get rid of your dark Square Bishop you will face the sort of H holes in your positions in your position E4 played by param he is very naturally going for his moves of course prag has to move his Bishop back to G6 and uh that seems logical yes he does Bishop G6 but this Knight on uh G1 is not so happy but it can go to H3 and F4 that's uh very much possible yes he plays his Knight out to H3 and he would like to place his Knight on F4 then eventually Castle Queen D2 and so on H param comes in and short Castle here by prananda he brings his King to save safy and now white also shot castles here which is a good idea so this position somehow looks around even but prag goes F6 and his idea is very simple he wants to play E5 get his Bishop then to F7 where it'll be more active so param really now expanding here he pushes his Pawn to F4 he pushes his Pawn forward for Ward prug goes E5 which is the best move in the position he also fights back in the center because not all the spaces for white and actually this leads to some positional repercussions because now if you see the central structure is that um white spawns so the central structure is such that White's pawns uh are on light squares here while the black pawn is on a dark Square on E5 so in that sense clearly prananda is positionally better but param has these Pawns in the center and they can become dangerous so Queen E1 played is param angling for G4 G5 could be but meanwhile prananda going here he's looking for the B3 Square then D4 his Bishop is well placed his Knight is well placed this is looking a like a very promising position for prag and that too with the black pieces after just 20 moves this is a nice feeling here uh and both prag and param are on one out of one so whoever wins this game becomes the leader of the tournament BR plays his Bishop to C4 and now this is a slightly uh weird decision because White's Bishop was not the best piece but what PR feels is that this bishop is actually controlling ring important squares like the D3 square and if I get rid of it then my pieces can start entering here in the center of the board so it's a more like not a positional one but a more Dynamic decision there by prag Knight F2 param is trying to control this Square also intending later to go Knight G4 to put pressure on the E5 Point Bishop takes Bishop has occurred and now Rook takes E2 is very likely to happen and that's what param plays he takes the bishop with his rook and now will prag get in to the C4 Square he does so he brings his Knight into the center of the board the Knight can look at the B2 Square also these critical squares here and param goes Knight to G4 he's also keeping an eye here but very importantly threatening F6 so King h8 played logical chess here by prag and now peram goes Rook F3 so now Rook D3 is not possible also he's brought his Rook up it feels like White's position is getting some kind of a semblance of uh plan you know there is some plan that is Flowing Rook D4 played by prag now he is trying to put pressure here but for now the point is well defended by white and maybe a very useful move yes H3 I really like this move because you make a lft for your King on H2 and you're putting pressure here you want to play F6 Rook F2 somewhere in there B5 played by prag and can he actually afford making a move like B5 maklu Now sort of lights up his eyes light light up he goes F6 is this Pawn sacrifice a good one prag takes it and he asks makulu why did you give up a pawn because if you take here this this is well defended point for me as black but maku's idea was rookie F2 and now all of a sudden he has play here on the F6 point now prag if he's unambitious he can take on e4 and then we have mass trades because F6 will also hang but instead prag goes very very ambitious he says I'm going to defend my F6 Pawn I'm a pawn up and I'm going to play this position but for param now this is the kind of positions he loves where there is initiative there is attack Knight at6 fantastic move look there is some pressure on G8 there's pressure on F7 and more importantly Knight is coming to F5 to Fork here so prag now jumps in Knight to D2 played he's attacking The Rook The Rook has to move but where exactly if you go Rook F5 you will lose this E4 Pawn so you may have to go Rook e 3 that seems like the best move he goes Rook e 3 he plays his Rook passively maybe PR can try and sort of repeat here Knight C4 but then there's already Knight F5 so maybe there's no repetition as well Queen E6 played by PR he's just trying to make certain moves also time wise both players down to their last five minutes for PR 7 minutes for peram and they have to make another eight moves Before Time control you know 30 minutes will be added after 40 moves Queen H4 played again slowly putting pressure here and also param wishes to get his Rook to G3 now Knight F5 looks like a very powerful move uh here for param attacking this here Rook but he goes Rook F5 and he is aiming for Rook H5 Rook G3 Knight F5 then put pressure here then The Rook coming here somehow it's just so easy to play as white here it feels he goes B4 and PR's idea here with B4 is to create some play on The Queen side the best move was to wait with Queen E7 but after B4 takes Rook takes now PRS pieces are slightly um offside the best move according to the engine is Rook F2 generally such moves are very difficult to find because they are backward moves also Pam had gone Rook F5 so he goes Queen G4 and for with Queen G4 his IDE is Rook G3 and just mate that's his plan it's a very simple but brutal plan Rook goes back to B8 and this is the problem when you have when you are just left with 3 seconds prag was down to his last few seconds and he makes a move very quickly and now param goes Rook G3 threatening a mate Queen E7 is the best move here just keep your queen there but prag wants to move his Queen somewhere else he has to make these decisions in just few seconds that are left so he needs to play quickly there you see prag getting really anxious because if he can't find the right move he'll lose he goes Queen D7 this is a mistake because now Queen H4 putting pressure here might be very strong also a move like King H2 but then Knight F1 check is in the air somewhere at in future so maybe peram can just make this very quiet move move King H1 oh he plays it with this prag under time pressure under 30 seconds has to find an accurate move a move like Queen E7 is good knight C4 is okay Rook d8 is maybe perhaps okay no he blunders big time with Knight E6 terrible move because now suddenly this is not hanging Rook takes F6 happens prug absolutely forgets it because Rook takes F6 Queen G8 is made look at PR's expression he's completely missed it ear earlier there was Queen takes Queen happening but the moment he put his Knight it blocked this diagonal and it is game over what a massive blunder by prag in one move yes he was under pressure but it was not losing by any means he could have fought on but param put so much pressure there that prag has simply lost this position in one move he stops the clock resigns param not thrilled with this Victory he knows that in the end PR could have defended Ed in a more staunch way but what a game this was PR seemed to have been in the better side of things for almost majority of the game but param got his kind of position in the end and the way he maneuvered his pieces on the king side was just very very instructive it's something that we can all learn from and param maklu with this win becomes the sole leader of this tournament with two out of two that's the kind of player he is rananda on the other hand did blunder big time but he's ready to discuss with his opponent and this is what is amazing about both param and prag whenever they lose they like discussing with each other with their opponents and this is why they both are the best players in the world it's a great great approach something that we can all learn from for now it's param maklu who managed to get the better of prananda"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

chess and two of the finest players of the country they playing against each other in Prague at the Prague Masters 2024 this is round number three this is also the first time that vidit and gukesh will Clash against each other after becoming candidates in fact not really they played against each other recently at Tata steel Wan and that game had ended in a draw but I guess this is their second classical game only they have played a lot of rapid and Blitz both exchanging and trading blows to each other I guess gukesh has a small plus there their classical game at Wan ended in a draw and now we are here with kukes having the white pieces opening the game with 1 E4 with it as always in his meditative pose before the game getting into the groove what is his move going to be he generally prefers to be solid and so E5 looks very likely and he plays his Pawn to E5 more than anything else this game is also a clash of styles gukesh is more creative he likes to attack he likes to play with the initiative vidit is more positional he's also very very solid off late he has also become very creative but let's see what happens in this game now the opening of course chosen by vidit is very solid he can play the pet which is what gukesh played with him in Wan but he goes instead for Knight C6 and now gukesh will he go for the Italian or the Spanish he goes for the Spanish the ru Lopez is on the board with Bishop B5 and with it goes for the Berlin with Knight F6 a very solid opening because you can go into the Berlin end game with castles but I believe gkes wants to keep more juice in the position and he goes for D3 also known as the anti Berlin the bishop comes out to C5 and of course we cannot really win the pawn right now after take take Knight E5 because of Queen D4 and you have a double attack so once gukesh castles now this becomes a real threat of taking the Knight and taking the pawn so vid it protects it with his Pawn coming up to D6 main moves here are C3 with the idea of D4 gkes think for a bit and plays Knight to C3 which is kind of getting the game into Four Knights territory because now you see all four Knights are developed here vidit quickly castles it out now one idea can definitely be to go Bishop G5 pinning this Knight but the other one is to go after this bishop here with Knight A4 and that's exactly what gkes has done he's telling with it that I'm going to take your Bishop pair like if you go Bishop B6 I'm just taking taking this and claiming I have a small Advantage because of the bishop pair with it says not so easily my friend I'm going to go Knight D4 he goes moves in with his Knight if you take the Knight he takes with the bishop and if you take my Bishop here I will take your Bishop Gish takes it so now taking on C5 is not a good idea because after I take the Knight I have the bishop pair and also the F4 break so that's the reason why with it takes Knight B5 now gkes has a very strong move here can he find it not to bring his Knight back because then C5 Knight D4 black is completely fine but A4 is the move and he finds it wo gukesh plays this very nice move the point being that the Knight really doesn't have a great Square to go to and so after you take I'm going to take back with the pawn opening up The Rook that's exactly what has happened The Rook has opened up on A1 now we have the the E5 Pawn hanging so you can actually go and pin this Knight but with it goes for Queen D6 the same position uh before Queen D6 was reached in the game between nepom nesi and yordan Van Forest many many years ago but what a move by GES here Knight H4 this completely changes the Dynamics of the position because now F4 is what with it is going for Rook d8 was played vidit may have wanted to go C4 but after B3 the bishop comes here and attacks this and that's the reason why he got his Rook here Queen E2 against the mo C4 so that now the queen is outside this line of fire and now Bishop G4 played by vidit an interesting move provoking F3 so that in future this diagonal opens up so F3 is played by gkes and also this Knight no longer can go back to the F3 Square so interesting Clash of ideas here Bishop E6 comes in but gkes is building up an attack with his Knight here Bishop looking here The Rook getting activated here this can become very very dangerous for withit and the move B3 played Queen D4 check does not win The Rook because Bishop can come out but with it goes Queen B6 now for Vi it he's threatening C4 check here and if King uh if you play C4 then the D3 Pawn becomes weak so gkes says to with it take my Pawn if you want but I'm going for an attack and with it actually boldly takes the pawn this is really very very bold play by both sides here now Bishop G5 by by gukesh has to be played yes he plays it so now he's threatening maybe to take maybe to play F4 with 1 2 3 4 pieces in the attack and the queen is a little bit offside with it unperturbed goes A5 he wants to play A4 and create play on The Queen side now F4 can be a very very powerful idea but Queen E3 played which is equally good he wants to take take and move his Queen to H6 gkes should focus on the attack with it plays A4 again not really caring for gk's threats this is amazing play Here and Now gukesh takes the pawn Rook takes Pawn very likely to happen and what white can do next is not to trade the Rooks yes here maybe just play Rook B1 once the queen moves away let's say Rook B4 you keep your pieces go for F4 taking your queen H6 it would be a huge attack but instead gkes loses Focus he takes on A4 this is not the best idea because after takes Queen takes yes he will recover his Pawn back after Queen takes C5 but he has lost the focus of the attack and now withd it can actually try and defend with Queen D4 very powerful move yes Queen C6 played nice move there because if Queen takes E5 there is Queen takes C2 D3 is weak so gkes now goes into an end game but what a position he had where he could attack yes his position still looks good because his Pawn structure is bulletproof here while Black's Pawn structure is mangled but still F4 played here now with it has to defend a bit carefully because clearly if he's not uh careful these pawns can become weak The Rook can eventually enter in he takes the pawn and now gukesh thinking for a bit he takes Bishop takes F4 attacking this Pawn on C7 now one of the quickest ways to fight for a draw is to play C5 C4 but with it first makes this passive move these passive moves are not easy to make because these players understand passive moves are not good for them but they do it because vidit wanted to go C5 C4 but gukesh has stopped it with Bishop E3 and now he goes Rook A8 trying to enter in with Rook A2 putting pressure here the Knight comes back from H4 it did its job it actually made the entire game so sharp with the last move that it had played Knight H4 now coming back to fight for the end game Advantage Knight E5 Knight D4 with it gets in with his Rook attacking the A2 C2 Pawn this Pawn needs to be defended with Rook C1 I think it's an important one yes Rook C1 played and now there is a small little threat because bishop4 will put pressure here on C7 so vidit needs to be a little bit careful about it he goes Knight D7 but has he considered anything for Bishop F4 is that can really put him under pressure and gukesh plays it Bishop F4 attacking C7 and you really don't want to play Rook A7 because with then Knight D4 attacking here things can can get very nasty he goes C5 gkes chops off the pawn and says to vidit what is it that you want to do well withit goes H6 how is it that you lose a pawn and then make this calm move Well turns out withit wants to hit with F5 and then Knight G5 would be a very irritating move so he plays at6 gkes goes King G1 the only reason why with it is still having a fine position here is because of the opposite colored Bishops that gives this game great drawing drawish Tendencies F5 played and now gukesh goes back Knight to D2 but the pawns are getting traded the pieces are coming off and now with it can take the pawn on e4 gkes can either take back with the pawn or with the Knight I think he'll prefer to take it with the Knight here and then yes he's still a pawn up but with it is liquidating this at such rapid Pace he's just completely getting rid of all the pawns C4 now played and so the remaining Pawn that white will have will remain a weakness gukesh tries to play this aggressively still by going D4 but the only issue here is that Bishop F5 now hits the Knight and if the Knight moves the pawn on C2 is falling so with that vidit has equalized this quite well he's done it quite comfortably although on during the game I'm sure he was a bit nervous there because gukesh had an extra Pawn but with it really showed character today the thing is when gukesh was coming all out at him with his pieces he did not back down he did not go on the defensive he in fact created counterplay on the other side of the board Bo by playing A5 A4 and I think that worked out for him quite well now gukesh is trying still for something if he can get King E3 D5 King D4 then there's something to play for but with it also bringing his King in King comes to F7 and now gkes will he bring his King forward thing makes makes the most sense to get his King to E3 here and then and Knight F6 is what very likely gukesh will do he can also think about King E6 but then there is D5 and King comes in so slightly careful there before rushing with your king Knight F6 makes a lot of sense now the idea is King E6 Knight D5 can gkes push his Pawn to D5 threatening King D4 yes he does it he pushes his pawn and if King King D4 comes in there's something to play for your king is more active C4 Pawn is slightly weak but with it finds this classy move Bishop E4 because if you take here I have Knight D5 check winning here oh winning the pawn back and gkes takes it and offers a draw because now after Knight D5 King D4 Knight C7 King C4 it's just a draw the players have agreed to it it was a fantastic fight here by both the players although the result was peaceful the game definitely was not I would say gukesh missed a golden opportunity there to attack better he could have played F4 at some point point vidit asked gukesh if you would like to analyze uh there they talk a bit and maybe they'll analyze for a bit trying to understand the nuances of the position this will be a mouthwatering clash in Canada Toronto the candidates which will start in roughly a month from now but for now the game between gkes and viit at the Prague Masters has ended in peace"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

this point of the game he was just a 2600 GM only 14 years old let's see how he FES against Magnus Magnus goes for this t attack as it's called with the bishop on G5 and Norbeck goes for a very solid setup we now slowly are seeming to move into the Queen's Gambit declined territory just that this Knight on B1 hasn't been developed Magnus chops off the Knight gives his opponent the bishop pair but says to Norbeck that your remaining Bishop on C8 is not very active what are you going to do about it and he goes H4 well Magnus is actually going all out you can see Norbeck just pausing a bit he's 14 years old but it's Magnus who has this youthful energy right now maybe he wants to go G4 G5 just open up the queen and the Rook Norbeck plays G6 being very careful Magnus now gets his KN out logical to develop also getting ready to Long castle and Norbeck puts his Bishop back so safy first approach by the youngster and that is wise when you're facing the world champion long Castle Magnus is not stopping at just H4 he's going to go all out C6 is he going to play G 4 as well is that on his mind yes it is he plays G4 nbe Abdu Sato hasn't developed all of his pieces he is under some pressure although the engine really likes Black's position and Norbeck calmly plays his Knight to D7 G5 not particularly a great idea because nbe now closes down the structure Magnus does go King B1 but black now doesn't have to worry about the king side opening up he LS his Queen to E7 all that he has to think is how to get this bishop on C8 into the game which may not be that difficult at some point you can play B5 B4 and the bishop can come out here Magnus wanted to make his move but is still a little bit confused I think the opening hasn't gone that well for him he did go out all guns blazing but suddenly has found himself short of ammunition now what next should he get to a simple developing position he goes CD which was logical and Ed opens up the bishop this side so Norbeck didn't even have to figure what way to get his Bishop out Bishop D3 played some pressure on the G6 Pawn but it's no real sacrifice to be worried about Knight goes to B6 Magnus plays his Rook to C1 you can see that his moves are not really in sync H4 G4 on the king side suddenly King B1 King C1 Rook C1 but he's just putting his pieces on decent squares and hoping that Norbeck will give him an opportunity at some point Bishop comes out to E6 now the Knight jumps back to E2 Bishop G4 he attacks the Knight the Knight drops back and asks the question to the bishop he takes it Queen takes now if you see that black can if at the right time push the pawn to C5 it would be amazing he goes F4 he weakens this E3 Square Norbeck attacks it with Rook E8 Magnus has to be careful next up C5 coming in this is becoming an amazing position for black because the bishop will open up the Knight is well placed and E3 Pawn is weak White Knight isn't doing much on H2 what is Magnus going to do he goes Rook E1 now Norbeck let's go C5 that is the move you want to play and I think that is the move he's calculating he has enough time on the clock no Knight C4 not particularly a great idea because now Magnus can actually take take and take the pawn and he can ask Norbeck to prove his compensation which does exist I must say but it's not enough for an advantage it'll give him equality takes and now Magnus is a pawn up although you can see the light squares are a bit weak the bishop is well placed the Knight is not in the game so black does have compensation for the missing Pawn but is Norbeck going to fight for some Advantage here he gives a check and Magnus quickly brings his Queen back you don't trade and go into an end game with Magnus Pawn down Norbeck also knows that so he has to keep the Queens on the board but where does he go with his Queen he goes back to D5 can we push the pawn yet not really the D4 Pawn will hang so Magnus first protects it he's now going E4 in the position and he what will Norbeck do suddenly from getting a very comfortable position out of the opening he's now under pressure and that's what happens with Magnus Carlson a laps in concentration and he's all over you Rook cd8 played blacks Rooks are nicely positioned in the center of the board but I think it's time to push the Central Pawn Magnus does it he pushes his Pawn to E4 Norbeck moves his Queen back to E6 and now white needs to get his Knight into the game but not yet because Knight F3 the queen will start entering and also the D4 Pawn E4 Pawn these are all soft pawns so Magnus has to play carefully he has the space and the pawns but he now has to protect them a good move here is Queen F2 defending F2 F4 D4 and H4 the queen really belongs on that square Magnus taking his time he's down to 50 seconds on the clock while Norbeck still has up above a minute Queen F2 found by Magnus you know he has this sense of Harmony in the position and he knows exactly where his Queen belongs and so on which is why he found this move now Norbeck what is his next way of creating play he goes Rook D7 he says that this Pawn is weak I'm going to jump on it and try to put pressure Magnus pushes his Pawn to F5 now he is actually in the driver's seat and I think Norbeck will collapse here because his position is falling apart F5 comes in and F6 is coming in in fact to shut down this bishop Norbeck takes his time the writing seems to be on the wall he plays Queen C4 F6 comes in Bishop f8 look at the speed at which Magnus is making his moves he knows these are now autopilot moves the Knight comes back the Knight can even jump into the center of the board now oo this is not looking good for Norbeck he plays his Rook to D6 just trying to improve the position very slightly hoping against hope that Magnus blunt ERS but Magnus Carlson does not blunder in such positions although here he's coming down to 30 seconds 95 played he's attacked the Queen the queen has to move away no point in sacrificing your Rook right now that there's no real compensation so you have to move your queen away he brings his Queen back that is the tenacious way of Defending Knight goes back to D3 and now you can see that again both the pawns are well guarded for the time being Norbeck goes in Queen G4 Knight comes to F4 blunder he takes it you can see Magnus Carlson so upset with himself he's missed it because Rook takes Rook is met with Queen takes Rook Magnus has to move his rook and now all of a sudden it's Norther Beck who's in the driver seat he's clearly better King A1 play B5 just improve your position slowly Norther back you are winning he pushes forward C5 is met with D5 he pushes C4 Magnus Carlson now has to defend this inferior position what a turn of events there one miss by Magnus and norbe gets back Rook D1 he takes the Rook Queen takes and now he pushes his Pawn to C3 you must take with the pawn because if you take with the queen there is a pin here and you can chop off the pawn on D5 Magnus now down to 10 seconds chops the pawn with the queen nor Beck was so alert takes here you can see that the white king looks a bit exposed while the black King looks safe and on the other hand these pawns H4 can become really weak H4 G5 F6 this entire Pawn chain can just fall apart he goes Rook D1 now have to play carefully he comes back but maybe Magnus is the one suddenly who's going to fight for the advantage Rook E8 played good move he takes the pawn queen goes to G4 Magnus brings his Queen back Rook comes to the center n back with just few seconds look at the way he's playing cck comes in he must take the Knight he doesn't now the F7 Pawn is hanging nor back once again finds the only move Knight C8 is winning here for white can Magnus find it not enough time he plays Queen D7 nor backck spots the defense he takes and now you can't take the Rook because your Rook is hanging he actually takes it check King up check again they both look at each other and shake hands it's a draw what a game that was"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

actually played simultaneously against 48 opponents at one given time he's an absolute genius on the board but when it comes to over theboard chess Magnus Carlson is way stronger than him nearly 250 ELO points above him the players shake their hands and off we go Magnus what is his first move going to be oh the clock has now started E4 is on the board timour plays E5 Knight comes out to F3 and Knight to C6 Bishop B5 played this is the ru Lopez A6 Bishop comes back to A4 and now D6 this is slightly less popular than Knight F6 move but Magnus doesn't Flinch he castles and now plays his Pawn to C3 in order to play D4 and we have G5 on the board this is a Timur G specialty he also played it later in this tournament against some players he's using his kingside pawns to gain space and push back Carlson's pieces but in return He is neglecting his development and creating weak spots but he's well prepared he goes Bishop H6 now Magnus brings his Queen up to E2 defending the bishop and Timur brings his Queen you can see the pressure on the D4 point is rising Magnus now takes the pawn he says that black your king is in the center and I'm going to open up the center well Timur garv can now long Castle the Knight is coming to C5 which is a juicy Square he plays Knight E7 and actually Magnus can now jump in with his Knight but he first goes Knight D2 calm move that's okay finishing his development he goes Knight to G6 and the Knight is angling to come on the F4 Square Magnus now plays his Knight to C5 Timur brings his Bishop back not a happy move to make you could have long castled here but he preferred to bring his Bishop back Rook comes to D1 centralizing and the Knight jumps in can Magnus pick up that Knight yes he does he takes it you can't take with the pawn because of E5 and Knight E4 so he takes with the bishop now but this means that magnus's position has stabilized a bit he brings his Knight back putting pressure on the bishop here on F4 Timur garv decides to play it safe he shot castles but the King on G8 is exposed now look at what Magnus does he first pushes the bishop back the bishop has to move it goes back goes back to H6 and now what do you do F4 what a move opening up this Rook G takes F3 is a mistake because after Knight takes you can see the Rook has opened up F5 square is weak Knight is coming to H4 this is all getting very dangerous Timur continues with Bishop G4 pinning the Knight Magnus moves his Queen away to the side and now Queen E6 played but the bishop comes back and the pressure on F7 point now mounts with the Rook Bishop over there Queen goes to E7 and what is Magnus doing he pushes the Bishop back first he wanted to move the Knight it couldn't because the Rook was hanging and now once the bishop is moved Knight H4 looking at the F5 Square so methodically Magnus has started to take advantage of the pawn pushes that were made in the opening you can see how Magnus Carlson punishes Timur garv for things which he did 105 moves ago now Queen G5 played Knight jumps into F5 a powerful knight Bishop goes back to B6 and white now plays his Pawn to H4 asking the queen to leave from here you can't go to G4 there is Knight at6 check which is a fork and so he plays Queen to F6 Queen goes to E2 now hitting the pawn on H5 Queen h8 played defending the pawn and now G4 Magnus is simply opening up things here if Pawn takes Queen will take it then a check and The Rook would join in so he plays Queen H7 and how is Magnus going to finish it he goes G5 you can literally sense Magnus knows this is winning for him but he just needs to finish it off he plays Knight at6 blocking the queen from defending this Pawn now attacking here and Timur Gare is going low on time he has only four three two he makes Bishop takes B3 move Magnus can actually well he thinks for a bit but then takes back the bishop that's the most natural move F6 played and now he takes the pawn so the queen moves in now you have the Knight and the Queen Bishop comes into E3 many many ways to win the most natural one is to attack the bishop with Rook F3 he goes Rook D E1 which is also a very strong move GV takes here whoo is that some kind of a good move or it's a blunder because the bishop is hanging yes you can't take here because the Rook is hanging but Magnus first takes the Rook Rook takes and now can he simply not take the bishop he takes it and Timor gar resigns what a resounding win for Magnus Carlson and just like that he has dispatched his opponent's ambitious play out of the opening you need to develop your pieces you need to have your king safe and Magnus Carlson showed it how one can actually take advantage of this fact by playing logic iCal moves in the center a lot to learn from this game from the world's

the players are on the stage maybe he was not aware of the starting time of this game he has the black pieces against Dennis kis matulin who's rated 2507 you can see how Magnus is calmly adjusting all his pieces the Arbiters begin to arrive maybe Magnus is in this mode today that he wants to arrive early and sort of focus himself his opponent comes to the board Magnus shakes hands with him Dennis kis matulin takes his chair and we are ready to begin Magnus has the black pieces Dennis has white opens the game with one D4 Knight comes out to F6 C4 and now Pawn up to E6 Knight comes out and Magnus chooses the Queen's Gambit declined Dennis brings his other Knight out Magnus has a variety of options to choose here he goes for the semi slow with C6 and white can go for Sharp lines with Bishop G5 but if Dennis is not in an ambitious mood yes he goes E3 which is also an ambitious way to play Magnus plays his Knight to D7 and now Queen comes to C2 this is the anti-an you are waiting with the development of your Bishop on F1 because when it moves then black generally takes on C4 and makes it move again but Dennis actually takes on D5 and Magnus quickly takes back because now this has equalized the space in the center but he has a concrete way to play he wants to come here and give a check Magnus gives a check blocks takes the bishop and now Dennis takes his time and takes it back with the Knight Magnus quickly castles now the Knight going to C7 makes no sense as there's no check so black is doing pretty okay the position out of the opening is slightly better for white the reason being this bishop which remains on the board is slightly superior to the black Bishop on C8 he goes Bishop A6 very calm move if you go Knight C7 there is Rook C8 taking this Knight but Den is castles mag chops it off Bishop takes and plays A6 you can feel that white is slightly better if he brings his Bishop back but Dennis's move Bishop takes D7 is a clear indication that he doesn't want to fight for the full point here a draw is okay for him against the world class player Magnus Carlson is especially at end games so he sees that there's only one open file the pawn structure is symmetrical let's trade off the Rooks let's trade the Queens later let's let's trade everything and then make a draw but Magnus says my queen is slightly more active I'm attacking the B2 Pawn Rook C2 played by Dennis he's very calm cool Magnus what a nice move Knight E8 he wants to bring his Knight to D6 and look at these two squares Knight comes out to F3 and now he takes the Rook Queen takes Suddenly It's white who has the control of the C file but black can put his Knight on D6 six that's what Magnus does and try to fight for the C file Dennis now pushes the queen away with A4 will Magnus move for forward with Queen B4 maybe not because then Knight E5 Queen C7 could be dangerous so he goes Queen E8 and now Dennis enters the position with Queen to C7 attacking the Knight and also the pawn so Magnus quickly offers his Queen for an exchange and Dennis can now simply take it or he can actually bring his Rook to C1 to defend the queen very calm cool play by Kish matulin and I think many many players here would agree to a draw Magnus trades of the Rooks as well there you have it a very very equal is end game but that's the thing about Magnus Carlson he's built an entire career on grinding equal end games and we should learn from him how he does it first he kicks the Knight away okay okay where will the Knight go now the Knight goes back to D3 a fine Central Square King is activated King is a very important piece in the end game and kiss matulin also follows it Magnus brings his King Dennis also brings his King this position is dead equal but you have to see how Magnus plays now first Dennis pushes a pawn one small thing has happened is that the E4 square has become slightly weak Magnus pushes his Pawn on A5 Dennis starts to gain space on the king side Magnus moves his King making way for the Knight to take up this Central Square for now it feels like Dennis is the one who's kind of playing aggressively in this end game and Magnus doesn't have a plan really but all that Magnus needs is to create a weakness so he plays his Knight to E4 uh D6 trying to go to the E4 Square Dennis pushes his Pawn forward and Magnus fixes this pawns now in some ways magnus's pawns are also weak but the White Knight doesn't have too many squares now you must calmly wait here Knight F2 that's a good move you're waiting Magnus will also wait here I believe no he goes F5 he forces now if you take here you will see that this Pawn becomes lonely so he pushes his pawn and Magnus again Waits with his King very important to wait again but he brings his Knight now Magnus jumps in you will see that there's a check threatened to pick up the pawn but it's important to move your knight back because taking this Pawn would trap the Knight sort of on that square but he gives a check now Magnus moves his King to the side and if you take here G takes H6 the beauty now which I think kusm matulin completely missed is that after check here King here Knight takes Pawn King f8 or F6 the Knight is trapped and I think that's the reason why he plays King D3 see but now you will notice that while black can calmly chop off the pawn here and come back with his Knight white can never take this Pawn because it traps his Knight what a unbelievable turn around here from a dead equal position Magnus is now completely winning and it changed in a matter of few moves how does Magnus culson do it well he creates weakness he sometimes entices his opponent to push the pawns he just understands end game so so well now he pushes the pawn kiss matulin says hey look I'm stopping your Pawn there's no way for you to push it forward but Magnus reorganizes his pieces he first brings his Knight to the center of the board King moves back and now he goes Knight where is he going with his Knight Knight to F6 and maybe the Knight now where where will it head from F6 is the big question he goes to D7 whoa Magnus is going Knight B6 so Knight H4 he attacks the A4 Pawn the king stops it and now the E3 Pawn is attacked kism matulin tries to defend it but now he has allowed magnus's Knight to come in with H4 H3 coming in K matulin resigns what a grind by Magnus Carlson this was beautiful just from a completely dead equal position he managed to win the game and I think one of the main reasons why he won was because kism matulin was too uh sort of he wanted to play for draw he wanted to play for equality and that you can never do against Magnus Carlson I'm on Wilder and we are going to revolutionize how social media works"}, {"instruction": "Generate a

candidates 2024 we have Hikaru Nakamura taking Fort he has the black pieces against Fabiano Karana two of the favorites in this tournament Clash against each other the All American clash in the first round and this is going to be very exciting Hikaru writes down his score sheet as he waits for his opponent to arrive the first round is always slightly jittery because players do not know the new environment that they are in sometimes it's cold in there sometimes there's less space sometimes you're just not ready for the fight but it seems like Hikaru has come into this tournament with no pressure at all as he keeps saying streaming has reduced his pressure multifold and there you have Fabiano kurana entering the only player with a rating of about 28 00 in this tournament and Karana is the big favorite there you can see nepom Nishi also telling Karana it looks a bit cramped here and we are ready everyone's sat down here Karana and we also have the sponsor of this tournament Isa shinberg here who comes in shakes hands with the players and begins Karana has played one E4 and you can see Nakamura thinking about what he has to play oh the pawn T is taken back maybe he changes his moves the players shake hands and off we go the first game of the candidates E4 has been played by Fabiano and will Nakamura respond with the super solid E5 which is part of his repertoire no he goes for the Sicilian he is going in for the fight against karwana the Knight comes out to F3 and Hikaru plays his Pawn to D6 generally when D6 is played we expect the Sicilian nidorf to happen will Karana play the open Sicilian or will he go for the check here it's also it's known as the mosow variation well he goes for D4 very logical move and I think the best move there takes Knight takes on the board and now Karana has played the open system Ian Hikaru goes Knight F6 here and Fabby plays his Knight to C3 A6 is the nidorf but Hikaru plays E5 and you look at Fabby he looks up E5 is not a common move here it's something which has not been played many times just because of this bishop B5 check and now it's tricky because if you play Bishop D7 I take take and play Knight d two and everything's perfect so he goes Knight D7 and here the added move that white has up his sleeve is Knight F5 attacking the D6 Pawn will Karana play it yes he does Knight F5 he seems to be well prepared but of course Hikaru 2 will be prepared here he goes A6 and he tells Fabby that if you take here I will take back with the queen defending this it's possible to play this and actually can happen but he but Karana plays Bishop A4 and Hikaru comes back he has 1 hour 58 minutes on the clock he's well prepared Here and Now pushes his Pawn to B5 pushing away the bishop now one of the big problems in White's camp in Black's Camp is this D5 Square which is terribly weak but Hikaru is playing around it he defends the D6 pawn and also wants to chop off the bishop on B3 Bishop comes out to G5 to take away one of the Defenders of the D5 Square next the Knight can reroot itself there but Hikaru simply chops it off before the Knight can actually move away very interesting opening here new opening in fact not really seen at top level that often e takes F5 and now he breaks the pin with Bishop E7 of course it's clear that Karana is slightly better here and he he takes on F6 very nice move and now after Bishop takes F6 what has essentially happened which you can see is that this bishop can actually sit down here on a beautiful square but you can't do it straight away because Rook C8 and then black is doing okay I mean you can play this way but Karu first decides to Castle and now look at this imagine a knight sitting here against this bishop that would be so terrible that would be just horrible and so Hikaru plays E4 opening up this bishop hoping that he can actually sacrifice his Bishop for that this is a very interesting moment now in the game and Karana sacks a knight he takes Knight E4 what a move the point is if you take back which Hikaru most likely will yes now you want to play Rook E1 and pin this Knight to the king and that is his idea and he plays it Rook E1 no point in playing your Pawn to D5 to protect it because the bishop will simply take it attacking the rook and the Knight so Hikaru says let me get out of here he castles Karana takes on e4 he's a pawn up also he can put his Queen here then bring his other rook in maybe play C3 to limit this bishop but Hikaru says well nothing of that's going to happen I first will chop off one pawn bishop takes B2 Karana plays Rook B1 and he's recovered his material and Hikaru wants to go back yes he goes Bishop back to F6 now let's take stock of the situation this bishop is active but is on the diagonal that's not very very relevant while this bishop is on the money diagonal it's a beautiful one the queen Mion so you can see how white is playing on the light squares while black is trying to play on the dark squares and it's very clear to me that Karana is slightly better pressing here nothing significant as such because even if black loses this Pawn on D6 but is able to trade the Queens it should be fine so Rook C8 played and this is very interesting because if you play Rook D1 uh and win this Pawn this is exactly what we were talking about it's not the end of the world for black but Karana starts to now say this is a weak Pawn I'll win it at some point I'm going to attack all these pawns now wow Hikaru Nakamura now has to be careful he brings his Rook up to C5 attacking the pawn on F5 but maybe Fabiano is okay to lose that pawn because it's a doubled Pawn if you see the pawn on F5 you can give it up you can chop off the pawn on A6 he takes up he takes on A6 six very interesting now Hikaru must take the pawn on F fire otherwise he's just a pawn down yes he takes it Rook takes F5 played and now you will see that the Rook from here defends the pawn on B5 although the pawn on D6 is weak and Karana now brings the rook in to attack that weakness how is Hikaru going to respond to this move well he pushes his Pawn to D5 and he says that right now my Rook is protecting here but guys don't you think that this Pawn is weak here yes Karana plays Rook B4 B5 Pawn is now toasted it's losing uh you're losing that pawn but Queen E7 is the best move and let's say if you take here there's already Queen E2 attacking here and pinning here but Hikaru does not play Queen E7 he plays Bishop C3 which is actually a mistake and it's based on a miscalculation because now Karana takes and he Karu has a tactic in his mind he takes on F2 look at that move his point is if you take with the King there's a check King goes back check King H1 Bishop E5 G3 is met with Bishop G3 H3 with Queen G3 and that was his point of Rook takes F2 but Karana calmly takes on D5 and he says to Hikaru well I now have two passers here yes this was a beautiful tactical move that you found but it is not helping you in any way Hikaru has to be careful now he plays Queen H4 I like this move you can't push G3 you'll get checkmated in one move but now it's time to bring your queen back to safety yes he plays it Queen D3 attacking the bishop and white king is safe for the time being nothing much is happening here Hikaru brings his Rook back to F6 clearly you mustn't take here Queen F2 and queen F1 is a Checkmate that happens so that's why he plays G3 uh nice move here attacking the Queen the queen has to move away and now Hikaru comes back well Karana is simply dominating the game Queen B4 played and now you can just trade off one of the active Rooks King takes F1 put the King on G2 push your Pawn to A4 white is having all the fun here but karwana wanted to play Rook F1 but then he changes his mind he goes King G2 which is also a fine move it's no no problems there only problem that white has is that his King is slightly weak you know you will say that there are only two pawns Sheltering the king Bishop B2 played by Hikaru can Fabby start pushing his Pawn well he goes Rook F5 and you see he's now tempted to trade that active Rook of black but maybe not the most ideal way to do it because now Hikaru plays F G6 and Fabby takes Bishop takes F6 and now the point is that this Rook on D5 was more active than the Rook on D1 so overall it seems like black has gained from this trade-off like if you play Rook F1 which is a nice move black simply goes King G7 and keeps everything together he plays Queen F3 black comes back Queen E7 and I think what Hikaru is essentially telling Fabiano is that Hey look it's very difficult for you to start to push your pawns on the queen side meanwhile I'm going to create play with H5 H4 perhaps he plays A4 anyway Karana pushes the pawn and where does Hikaru bring his Rook well first he decides that he wants to improve his King good decision and and now Karana can he push the pawn is this a good idea why not right just push the pawn forward well maybe that's the that's the way you want to play yes he pushes the pawn forward he maybe can get A6 and Bishop C4 that would be pretty strong he can also put his Bishop here once in the center and then this Pawn really starts to roll what is Hikaru going to do and what is his idea well he's looking to move the Rook maybe to see8 no he plays Rook 8 what a nice move because Queen A8 is met with Queen E2 check and you lose this Rook that is the point so he plays Rook D5 trying to defend the pawn and now Hikaru just plays Rook A7 this Rook not only stops the pawn but also defends F7 now Karana plays his Rook to B5 he puts his Rook on B5 and Hikaru now goes Queen to d8 well he puts his Queen on d8 square and maybe he just wants to enter here on D2 that is his idea and you can see that because of the weakness of the white king black is constantly getting some play he plays his Rook to D5 Queen can come back to E7 and repeat the position but Hikaru goes Queen C7 and tells fabii how are you going to defend the A5 Pawn You're simply losing it so maybe Karana can shift his attention to this Pawn now he plays Pawn to H4 and his point is if you take here take here take here he wants to enter with Queen B7 and attack this Pawn which cannot be defended look closely there so maybe Hikaru has to be careful oh he takes it he takes it he's unfaced Hikaru seems to be okay with this next M Queen B7 because if that's not coming black is completely fine yes Queen B7 there's simply no way to defend this what does Hikaru Nakamura have on his mind you can see him very calm and relaxed which means he already has seen the solution here what he wants to do yes he just plays Queen d8 and he defends the bishop so if fabii takes here which he does then he plays his King to H6 and now the queen is coming in to give checks here to the king and that seems like a Perpetual check so again if you think about it Karana here got a great position out of the opening was pressing endlessly by the this is the 40th move so the players are going to get 30 minutes extra now Hikaru plays his Queen to E7 offering a trade this end game is drawn because this bishop controls the C Pawn the king can come back into the game and this is so you you don't take the Queens garana you can see is assessing what happens if he takes the queen there but I think he he'll refrain from it and he plays his Queen back to C4 and Hikaru seems to have wriggled out of the mess well he comes in Queen E3 and offers a draw here to his opponent because now Bishop E5 attacks here and uh well it's not very common that the player who's pawned down of was a draw but here I think Hikaru is very very sure that he's completely fine and a draw has been accepted that's the end of the game a nice battle between these two players and in the end it was a draw but karwana fought really hard iaru showed his amazing defensive skills for which he's well known in the Chess World [Music] your"},

best players in the world takes fort with the white pieces today in the first round of the fiday candidates 2024 this is already the second candidates for fuja he's just 21 years old and what a talent he is he's already playing his second candidates but his opponent is much younger 18-year-old prananda will play his first candidates you can see fuja has come early to the game he's wearing a green jacket I wonder if it's from the wisen house tournament but it doesn't look like it uh this has a much more dark green tinge to it and of course fuja would have learned a lot of lessons from his first candidate's appearance which was not very ideal for him and would be looking to put all of that to good use in this event his opponent prananda has been training with the super GM Peter swidler there you see prug arrives shakes hands and prag is such a big big star in Indian chess and he's definitely you know gunning for that top spot in order to challenge ding Len for the ultimate World title prag has the black pieces we already have a massive encounter in round one let's see how this goes all the pieces arranged by prananda and fuja looks a little bit sort of in his own world you know looking elsewhere not on the board it's basically France versus India fuja now represents the French flag and off we go 2 hours for 40 moves without any increment and then 30 minutes additional fuja opens the game with 1 E4 now prananda generally takes his time in the opening and he does so here as well and now pushes his Pawn to E5 it's E4 E5 very simple very solid fuja brings his kn out to F3 this Knight attacks the pawn in the center prananda defends it with Knight C6 and we have the ru Lopez what a start to this event playing the most solid opening and the most prestigious event PR says A6 and he tells fuja do you want to go for the exchange Ru Lopez fuja says no thank you I go back Bishop A4 now there are many many ways to play but Knight F6 is clearly the main move and fuja goes for the main line with castles Bishop E7 leads to the closed variation of the ruie Lopez but prananda now chops off the pawn on e4 this is known as the open Ru Lopez it's a risky Pawn to be taken because now white plays D4 and if you take here you are in trouble because this opens up the file here and that's the reason prag goes B5 Bishop goes back to B3 and now puts his Pawn on the center of the board defending the Knight Here pawn takes on E5 and notice that the D5 Pawn is hanging so prag defends it with Bishop E6 this is all well-known Theory and seems like Prague has chosen the open Ru Lopez as his weapon for this tournament we'll see whether he'll keep shifting or whether he'll come back to this opening fuja now LS his Pawn to C3 this is very logical next up you bring your knight out Bishop back and so on and prananda now thinking he has a few moves up his sleeve he goes Bishop E7 it was also possible to develop this bishop actively on the C5 square but he chose it to put it on the E7 Square white brings his Bishop back now this bishop is attacking the Knight but it's well defended and so for prag a very logical move now can be castles it's a simple move because there's no real threat but he goes Bishop G4 he moves that piece again as soon as the bishop left its pressure here he goes Bishop G4 and now look at this move by fuja he says come take my knight because then after this if you move back I can slowly start to move my pawns so that's a very cool move Queen E1 and prag is well prepared he goes Knight C5 already trying to put his Knight on E6 fuja now defends his Knight on F3 now you might be a bit confused with this move Queen E1 is it a novelty not really gukesh has already played it against yakub boev before so it's a well-known move and this position has been reached before that's the reason why you will see prag has 1 hour 54 minutes while fuja has 1 hour 57 minutes on the clock the Knight goes to E6 and now the king comes to H1 again an idea that gukesh played in that game one plan is to just move the Knight away and Hur the F Pawn down the board that's the reason why he goes Bishop H5 because if Knight G1 he wants to put the bishop here and trade it off so that's prophylaxis here Knight B3 played by fuja very interesting move because if now Bishop G6 then Queen to and you want to defend it this way BR says sorry alira I am taking your knight and destroying your structure and so now the structure is a bit mangled up the idea is F4 F5 if white gets that in prag is in Pre Under Pressure so he goes Bishop G5 good move F4 is not possible now because you simply lose the pawn and that's the reason why fuja now plays Rook G1 and he tells prag I'm attacking this also this is the advantage I received because my G file has opened up but prag the advantage that he has gotten is that now after exchanging he has the control of this Square you can't take Queen C1 because then Queen H4 comes in to increase the control so he plays it with a knight and he wants to put his Knight on D3 and push the pawn forward so very interesting position now is developing with white idea clearly being to start pushing his pawns while fuja uh br's idea is to stop it he's brought his Queen in and he's stopping that he's also ooh fua brings his Rook up and he says to the queen if you go back I'm all ready to start pushing slowly and steadily in that position so prag has to be carefully he goes Queen H5 now you can't push because you lose your rook and and what does alira fuja do next now he plays his Knight to D3 fantastic this Knight on D3 is beautifully positioned it defends this it promotes the idea of f4 and fua might want to just go Queen E2 and Rook G1 so his position is suddenly starting to look a bit cohesive now PR castles and I think that's a logical move also next up I think he may want to get his Rook here and start attacking the E5 Pawn fuja plays Queen E2 I like this move because this move indirectly defends the rook and now guys F4 F5 can be an idea so if you play Rook E8 Rook G1 maybe G6 already you have to be very careful with this move F4 coming up but prag now has pushed his F Pawn down the board and played F5 very cool move fuja has to take and guys what has happened here notice that suddenly the idea of f4 F5 has lost its charm but now the E file has opened up with the queen being here and The Rook can swing over this is very interesting also do not forget that this E5 square has been in whites control on the other hand blacks trumps are clearly visible these pawns are weak on F2 and F4 pragnan nanda's Queen is menacingly positioned by the way look at these two queens staring off against each other oh PR threatens mate in one here on H2 Square tricky prag tricky prag attacking the H2 pawn pawn comes up to F3 defending this rook and also defending this Pawn on H2 now the Rook comes in to f8 keeping up the pressure on the F4 Pawn with his Knight and the Rook alira fuja now moves his Queen yeah where is he moving it Queen F2 I think slowly and steadily the position is so complicated and has so many nuances because both sides have weaknesses this Knight is beautifully placed here on C6 to stop the white knight from coming to E5 but it's slightly passive there and the time also 34 minutes for alira while prag down to also 34 minutes they both have to play 16 more moves Rook ff6 has been played and fuja brings his Rook to the E file that's a very logical move cuz later on he may want to play Rook Knight E5 followed by Rook coming up here BR brings his Queen back to F7 I like this because now you see there's one attacker two and three attackers on the F4 Pawn how will he defend it is the question here fuja he plays his Queen to G3 he defends it this way he also keeps pressure here on the G7 Pawn it's as if all the pieces are just moving one or two squares at a time that's how closed and complicated this position is BR goes Rook H5 maybe he wants to shift the Rook here and attack this one more time or maybe he wants to shift his other rook and attack here on H2 so fuja actually is under some pressure now he goes A4 I like this move maybe he just wants to take take and get his Rook to A1 and enter from the a file that might be the idea in the position but prananda takes his time and plays Rook H6 nice move Rook H6 played and the thing is if you are able to get this move Rook H2 Queen H2 Rook H2 King H2 it's an advantage to Black because white has so many weaknesses and whenever you have weaknesses Queen generally gets stronger than the two Rooks that's the reason why alira fuja defends his Pawn on H2 that's what he does now Rook H3 attacking the Queen the queen has to move where does it go fuja down to 5 minutes he has to play 12 moves no increment remember he plays his Queen to E1 prananda still has 16 minutes the position is looking interesting still E6 Knight is under pressure he goes Rook takes F3 this is not a great idea because imagine now Knight C5 great move if you take the Knight I have Rook E8 and you lose the queen so that cannot be any good and so Knight C5 prananda now has to play Knight f8 but he goes Queen H5 what a move now rookie G2 good move and this would give a big big Advantage here but he instead goes 96 maybe not the best choice because now Queen takes G4 is possible this move Queen takes Rook has happen black is exchange up Knight G5 played by fuja with 3 minutes on the clock he's threatening mate in one here with Rook E8 not at all easy to stop but prananda needs to find some good move here he has two defenses with knight7 and knight5 why are both these moves strong the reason is after 95 fantastic move if you take with the pawn I take Queen G5 and I'm completely winning I've shut down the E file and if you take with the Rook which is what alira is planning to do this is the key point now The Rook is no longer guarding the H2 Pawn so here prag finds the stunning defense Rook H2 King H2 notice there's no Checkmate here because the Knight controls the square but you can play Queen check Queen to F4 check Queen H5 check check both are possible prag takes his time there he has 3 minutes to work it all out and see if there's anything he's missing but I don't think he is missing anything he has taken on H2 and this has been such a complicated game both players matching move for move fuja had a small chance if he had found rookie G2 but he was unable to and now PR plays Queen H5 check if you go King G2 I'm going to give you a check again if if you go uh anywhere else let's say King G1 I will again give you a check here so it's not a big difference King G2 played and PR has to give this check again the King has no real squares it can go to H1 but then there also I'm just simply going to check you from H5 uh that is the thing right now white has two extra pieces but it's not enough prananda has basically worked this out to a draw um fua just thinking whether he should go to H2 or H1 which is a logical question he decides to go to H1 and if only he had the move he would have checkmated prag with Rook e 8 but PR gives a check King G2 played and I think they repeat again Queen G4 both players didn't want to draw this game they are such Fighters they both want to fight and as you can see no one's offering a draw really let's see who is the first one to offer a draw here fuja looks at the score sheet and he says I'm going to play King G2 and offers a draw the Arbiter comes in uh and yes he says I'm going to play my king to G2 I think that is uh game over what a interesting battle by both of them I think the Arbiter is just checking and I guess they have to agree because it's been repeated three times also both the players I'm sure wanted uh are completely fine with the draw because there's no way out of it so the first game of this match uh of this tournament candidates between fuja and prananda has ended in a draw and the players shake hands they agree and that is the end of the [Music] game [Music] yeah"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

players at the candidates in the women's section we have vishali with the white pieces taking on keru humpy this promises to be a fantastic Clash here because it's the Battle of generations Vali very young just born in 2001 while humpy has been at the top of Chess and women's chess for years she's born in 1986 well we are ready to kick off a shake of hands Vali with white what will she play She generally likes to open the games with one E4 she takes her time here and before deciding to make her move she's thinking what exactly should be done it's a rule in the candidates that players from the same country should face each other in the initial rounds itself to avoid any problems later on e4 played by Wali and humpy responds back with E5 a solid response there and Vali brings her Knight out to F3 humpy is definitely known for her very unique style of play she is a universal player in my opinion more tending towards positional chess but she understands the game so well and she's such a fighter she can keep grinding on for hours meanwhile vali's naturally instincts definitely is to go for an attack and by that um Logic the Italian opening is a very good choice the bishop comes out to C4 and humpy now has to decide whether she wants to go Knight F6 which is one of the main moves here or Bishop C5 which is the other main move in this position she takes her time for a bit thinks and it's making her choice she's thinking about it what to play and here she decides to go Bishop to C5 well it will be interesting to see what will be wali's choice will she go for a very quick C3 D4 which is getting popular this direct one direct way to play but also very interesting is to just play C3 and D3 with a slow setup that is there Wali has come to this tournament with sandipan Chanda who is the second who is her second and trainer while humy has come to the candidates without any trainer uh here I'm sure she has the trainer back home but for now she is alone in Toronto Canada so right now Wali taking her time this basically the opening both the players are taking quite a bit of time for to make their moves and uh let's see what Vali comes up with she is thinking and she plays her Pawn to C3 and humpy now Knight F6 is the main move in the position she plays it she brings her Knight out to F6 and Vali now can play either of the two things D4 or D3 she instantly goes D3 this is known as the slow Italian where white is not rushing in to make any decisions but black plays the move H6 now this is slightly less common as compared to the move D6 or short castles but H6 has the simple idea of stopping Bishop G5 move which can get very sharp and I think humpy wanted to avoid these lines against Wali so Wali goes for B4 and one of the things here is that you can put your Bishop here and it might seem like with B5 you will lose a piece because Knight E5 is hanging but Knight A5 is a good move and after Knight E5 you just castle and later on you have D5 coming up the bishop is hanging and this is very good compensation so with B4 Bishop E7 was played by uh humpy and now Wali over here brought her Knight out to D2 you have castles there by humpy again not worried about losing this Pawn because Knight A5 Knight E5 and just D5 gives black excellent play this is a typical way of continuing and I think Vali will not get tempted into it she goes short castles which is a good move later on white can even expand further with A4 A5 B5 in this position uh hump now pushes her Pawn to D5 so she takes Central control and now if you by the way take Knight takes it's still the same issue like B5 is met with Knight A5 so Wali just drops her Bishop back and in a way humpy can take here take here and equalize the space in the center but she goes A6 and her plan is to maybe play B E5 at the right moment so white can actually play A4 here that's very normal but Vali goes A3 and I think somewhere Vali is Keen on maybe take Knight takes playing C4 when her pawns are protected but here humpy goes Bishop E6 just finishing her development you can see these two little pawns on A6 and H6 stop any Knight jumps from happening and Vali brings her Rook to E1 so it's a slow game but now there is a threat to take take and maybe the E5 Pawn is a little soft so humpy should be careful although it's not really hanging she goes B5 and she tells Vali if you take take and take here then I can simply take Rook takes and put my Bishop here and attack this C3 pawn and win material so that's the reason why taking on D5 and E5 is not such a great idea and that's why aali goes Bishop B2 the bishop protects the C3 pawn and that's the reason why now humpy takes on e4 um you can take back with the pawn you can also take with the Knight it seems like taking with the pawn seems more logical Vali thinking here and she takes back with the pawn pawn takes on e4 and now humpy can take this bishop by the way just to note here after humpy took here Bishop takes E6 was not possible because of e takes F3 interm medo so that's the reason why D takes E4 D takes E4 Bishop takes Bishop Queen takes Bishop has occurred and and if white can get A4 or C4 here either of the two moves white can start to press a bit but fantastic move here by humpy to play A5 and now you can see B4 will become weak you cannot really take here because after Rook A5 A3 and C3 both pawns are slightly weakened so goes Knight to F1 that has been played and uh maybe Wali wants to play Knight G3 to F5 what is humpy going to do next she goes Queen C8 very interesting move I think she wants to maybe put the queen on B7 maybe to E6 so some possibilities there Vali brings her Knight to E3 and well if you take on e4 then there is this very powerful Mo Queen D5 which is a double attack on both the knights so that's the reason why hum offers the trade of queens and her point is that after take here she no longer has to worry about the weakness of the F5 and D5 Square Wali declines the trade and she puts her Knight on D5 humpy moves her Rook to d8 now uh where does Vali play next she goes Knight F6 here uh you cannot really take this because you will lose your queen which is pinned there so that's why a check Bish Bishop takes was possible but this time humpy thinks it's not such good idea to trade Queen so she takes Queen takes F6 and now the Rook comes into the center of the board with Rook a D1 humpy moves her Bishop to D6 on a Central Square you can see that both Bishops are slightly worse Black's Bishop longterm because the pawn is on on the same color White's Bishop is blocked by its own pawns here on A3 B4 C3 Rook db8 played controlling the B5 square and now Wali brings her Rook on the dile she's making natural logical moves but I think uh humpy can now claim a small little Edge by kicking this knight uh Rook away then rerouting the knight from C8 to B6 to C4 she first goes Rook Queen E6 the idea is Knight E7 to kick the rook and then Queen is hanging so goes Queen C2 and now Knight E7 seems like a logical move so The Rook is pushed away and Rook five D3 played so humpy slowly and steadily creating some inroads the Knight now has two good options one is to go from C8 B6 to C4 D is to go to G6 to F4 humpy decides to go slightly more positional she goes Knight C8 and where is vali's play coming from she goes Knight to D2 maybe she wants to put her Knight on B3 and A5 putting pressure there Knight B6 played so step by step the pressure keeps mounting here on Wali and she needs to find a good move now couple of good moves very important she plays her Bishop to C1 she realizes that this bishop is not going to be getting active from B2 let me improve this bishop and this is very useful because in future when something concrete will start to happen having the bishop there already will make a huge difference so Bishop E7 played by humpy maybe she wants to play her Bishop to G5 and Knight goes to F1 well black has many many moves here one is to play C5 you know now the bishop is no longer hanging on D6 and black would be slightly better but goes Queen C6 and I think humpy's idea of course is to put pressure here but Bali simply ignores it pulls her Knight to E3 and tells humpy you can never take here because of this check that is there in the position so humpies move Queen C6 doesn't seem very logical after Pawn takes you can take back with the a pawn or the C pawn and for now Wali decides to take back with the c Pawn yes this A3 Pawn is a weakness but that does not uh matter so much because um with one weakness white can easily hold on to things Rook Queen takes Queen Knight takes Queen has happened now this Knight defends A3 and B4 so Knight belongs there and Rook d8 played here by uh humpy and King F1 by Wali bringing the king into the game Rook takes Rook Rook takes Rook pieces are getting traded slowly and steadily and uh does humpy do she goes Rook to d8 she brings her Rook to the center of the board offering a trade and King E2 by Wali yeah that's a nice little move by Wali and somehow well A3 is a weakness but as as we said it's very firmly defended so that's the reason why Vali understands that there's not much she can do um but so can humpy also cannot do much I think this game is heading towards a draw the king comes to f8 the bishop comes to E3 and now maybe there's a threat like if you are careless and play King E8 Bishop takes B6 cb6 definitely gives white to play for something here so moving the Knight to C4 seems logical also A4 here is not possible to shake this up because of check and I can take this Pawn so goes King C3 here waiting and you don't want to be taking here because such a position is not so easy to fight with black pieces so King E8 played by humpy very calm cool she has all the experience on her side playing such positions so she's not going to falter in a big way F3 played maybe both the players will play until move 40 and then once the time pressure is gone uh they will just agree to a draw because it's 30 seconds left for Wali she's down to her last seconds while humpy has a minute on the clock Pawn push to H5 and he goes she goes Bishop A7 uh maybe just trying to hassle the black position a bit the Knight comes back to D6 and what does Wali do next now she plays her Bishop to C5 you're going to see some trades Happening Here seems quite natural Knight to B7 was played Bishop moves away and I think the players have found an ideal way to repeat moves and agree to a draw because Knight D6 Bishop C5 you can see humpy uh thinking there there's a gap of around 70 points between humpy and Wali so clearly humpy has the higher rating but she knows that vali's wal is someone you cannot underestimate on any given day she can play some excellent chess Bishop A7 is played Knight D6 and I think the players have agreed to a draw a good fighting game uh here by both the players humpy seem to be putting slightly more pressure but Wali resisted well after the game we spoke to Vali here is her interview I'm here with Vali Wali did the game start getting slightly under pressure for you uh because the time was running a bit low also the position looked a bit tense yeah yeah at some point I think I was worse like my position uh it became like very passive and I just gave everything what like she can hope for Queenie 69 everything and I was really worried at some point like I was also getting low on time but thankfully I think this queen SE Queen se6 was not accurate like I got KN E3 and uh yeah and then it was fine because E4 was not4 was not Hing so um instead of Queen C6 maybe she could have played C5 or something I don't know uh yeah it was not clear for me at all what I'm doing but even after Queen C6 and the Queens got traded did you feel that there was some pressure or you thought that after that it's all okay I thought it's already fine like I get King E King F1 King E2 and my A3 is defended like only weakness and uh yeah she might play like Knight C4 double The Rook on a but I was I thought like I'm already under control with the Queens on the board and I was not sure like especially with Pawn on C3 my light squares are weak Queen on E6 I think my Rook D5 was uh really bad I gave her this queen E6 I could have played Rook D3 I think and then double the r on D line and uh it should be fine were you surprised with her move B5 in the opening no I was expecting actually um yeah A6 B5 this structure like I thought she might do that I was uh that's why I played uh yeah for A3 this B5 was my concern that's why I spent a lot of time on A3 because I also had option Queen C2 where this B5 doesn't work like I can just go direct A4 but after this A3 I've spent one move there so I didn't want to go A4 uh yeah I was expecting B5 generally first rounds are very stressful in such events and facing humpy how uh did it add to the pressure or how was it no I was very excited to play her like uh we have not played so much uh over the board uh this is the second game actually and uh also this tournament I've been looking forward to it like really we've been preparing it for months and I'm very happy to start the tournament and when uh now that the first round is over do you feel more relieved like was there more t as you said maybe there was some pressure yes yes uh yeah it took some time in the opening like you know to get into the I mean the game thing and U yeah I can say that I'm sort of Rel and here generally when you are playing uh prag is in the same Hall but here it's very close right like every day it must be like next to each other maybe it's the first time sort of so close in every round it would be uh yeah like okay we have played in same tournament all but probably this is like the very closest to I think yes and and does that add pressure or does that make you feel fine uh it's fine but sometimes when like things totally go wrong in his board sometime it's very stressful also like I remember in Prague when he lost to raport I was like totally shocked I was playing my game and I didn't know what happened how it happened and yeah there are times where I was really worried with this game but uh yeah it's just normal we have been playing together for many many years and we check each other's game and sometimes it's stressful also well thank you Wali and good luck for the next rounds thank you [Music] sir [Music]"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess match.

stage is set for the absolutely big Clash viit Gujarati enters the screen with his bottle of red juice and water he's taking on Hikaru Nakamura the world number three in the second round of the freeday candidates 2024 viit takes his chair and we all know what he's going to do next he's going to close his eyes and meditate there you go black lotus op that's the app he uses for meditating you can see the Indian flag there and right opposite it is the US flag because world number three Hikaru Nakamura represents United States and is one of the finest players in the world of Chess and there you have him enter the screen Hikaru maybe comes with a cup of coffee he takes his chair he hadj justs all his pieces he likes to do that uh writes down the score sheet first in the background you see nepo walking around we have cameraman there capturing this important moment Hikaru with the white pieces would love to get a win in to this candidates he's one of the favorites to win this tournament he himself says that he's under no pressure because playing chess is not his main profession he's a streamer and a content creator there you see him adjusting all his pieces vid it is not on the board he's walking around and there back the games are about to begin it's 2 hours for 40 moves and then 30 minutes increment and off we go Hikaru opens the game with one E4 and with it once again gets into the Zone it's interesting to see that with it not only sort of closes his eyes and meditates before the start of the round but also before his first move and now what is the move that he's going to play he can go for the aggressive Sicilian with C5 he can play maybe the kokan maybe the French but very likely that he'll go for the solid move E4 E5 there amazing that he's spending this time roughly a minute to get into the zone so many youngsters are actually motivated by with it to act to close their eyes and meditate before the game let's see if that helps him today what is with its first move going to be I'm sure he considered Hikaru opening the game with E4 and he responds back with E5 the super solid E5 and now Hikaru will most likely put his Knight on F3 and we'll see a classical opening happening today is Hikaru thinking about King's Gambit F4 no not really he brings his Knight out to F3 attacks the pawn on E5 five well with it has the uh has the pet in his repertoire so he can go Knight F6 here he can also play yes Knight C6 this is the normal way to play Knight to C6 and Hikaru can now put his Bishop on C4 the Italian or the ru Lopez he goes for Bishop B5 presses the clock now with it is known for his super solid style of play and he sticks to it and goes for Knight F6 the Berlin will Hikaru allow the Berlin end game no he plays the anti- Berlin with D3 and this leads to much more complex positions and uh with it plays Bishop to C5 now there are two ways for white to play one is to take take and then continue and another one is to not take and continue the game let's see what Hikaru chooses he doesn't take and pushes his Pawn to C3 now with it can Castle here with black uh there are also some aggressive moves like D5 yes he castles this is the normal way to play and you must know that if Bishop takes C6 B takes C6 Knight takes Pawn does not really work because D5 and black is quite ahead in development so Hikaru just castles it out and now tells with it what is your next move going to be well the most logical move now is to play D6 yes you bolster your Center open up the bishop maybe you want to pin here with the bishop coming to G4 and so Hikaru quietly pushes his Pawn to H3 stopping that pin and next move maybe he wants to push his Pawn to D4 what is VI it going to do ooh he goes 97 now this is a very dangerous move why because once you move your knight away from C6 which was defending the E5 Pawn white can push in the center with D4 and he does it Hikaru pushes his Pawn to D4 asking with it what do you want to do because if you take take this is a great position for white with solid Center so with it now play C6 this is a novelty look at hikaru's expression he didn't expect it because the main move here is Bishop B6 when if white takes the E5 Pawn then E4 hangs but after C6 Hikaru brings his Bishop back well you could take here dc5 CB CD Knight G6 this is what vidit would have analyzed but Hikaru says to vidit now I've protected my E4 Pawn your Bishop is hanging if you take I get the strong center with it quietly goes back wow has he sacrificed the pawn here guys well he can play for Knight D2 but also so Hikaru is tempted this is a free Pawn in the center he chops off the pawn I'm very curious to see what will happen next now with it takes back the pawn now and Hikaru quickly chops off the pawn on E5 Hikaru has used 41 minutes on the clock withit has used only 5 minutes he's still in his preparation what is withit's idea here has he just lost a pawn you can see with it quietly thinking about this move has he got something who sacrifices the bishop what's the point here guys GH3 Queen B8 if the Knight moves Queen G3 the pawn is pinned and if you play Bishop F4 here to protect I have Bishop C7 winning wow what a move here by with it Bishop takes H3 Hikaru seems to have calculated it he's not interested to take the pawn he goes Knight to C4 this is a mistake he should have taken the bishop and in that line he still is doing okay which was uh after Bishop F4 Bishop C7 Bishop G3 takes and F4 but instead he goes Knight C4 and now with it can save his Bishop yes Bishop G4 he saves his Bishop he attacks the queen and asks Hikaru what are you going to do next the queen has to move because F3 is impossible the pawn is pinned here Hikaru thinking and playing Queen C2 after 8 minutes of thought with it still ahead on time and now he has to choose between two options one is to save his Bishop with Bishop C7 the other one is to go Knight G6 because Knight G6 also very tempting after take take he has 1 2 three four pieces in the attack here no he goes Bishop C7 he keeps his Bishop this is an important one but has with it calculated it at accurately because Hikaru can now push the pawn attack the Knight the Knight moves he will take on H7 that is the plan here and Hikaru comes back writes down his move with it goes away Hikaru is he pushing the pawn yes he does he pushes the pawn well inaway with it now has to decide where to move the Knight does he go to D5 which is the best move or to D7 which is the second best move he play plays Knight D7 and he attacks the pawn on E5 if you go like let's say a move like F4 that is not a great idea so Hikaru just goes and chops off the pawn he says thank you with it for the Free Pawn but now this bishop can get trapped with G6 the important move here for Hikaru to find is Queen E4 which is not at all easy like Queen E4 F5 and then Bishop takes your Bishop takes Queen H4 followed by Bishop G5 is best but Hikaru plays Bishop D3 this is not a good idea now you can play B5 kick the Knight and then chop off the pawn on E5 in fact you can even directly take on E5 with it will he push the pawn yes he does he pushes the Knight away and he says to Hikaru I'm okay that you won this Pawn next move I'm taking here and guys what you will witness now after with it takes the pawn on E5 is Black's pieces are tremendously active so after Knight takes E5 which he does you will see that one 2 3 4 all active while o Hikaru makes a big blunder hikaru's all the pieces are still on their starting positions Bishop E2 is a mistake he should have taken here on G4 Bishop E2 now allows with it to play F5 and he finds it what a classy move because now if you take here I'll take with my pawn and next move I have Knight F3 check ideas with the Knight moving Queen H4 coming in wow he plays this move F4 and Hikaru does not like his position look at this move F4 is opening up this entire diagonal and with it sacrifices his Knight in the center of the board Bishop B6 you can see Hikaru did not consider that move he's shaking his head he's so unhappy the point of course is that if you take your Knight D5 jumps in Queen G5 coming in all sorts of moves are coming in so Hikaru now plays his King up to F2 with it comes back from the from the room behind which is actually the refreshment room for the players hikaru's idea is to free The Rook to come to H1 and give a check but that's just one check nothing more nothing less with it comes in with his Knight into the center of the board wow what a game this is turning out to be we are just on move number 20 and with it has 36 minutes Hikaru has just 12 minutes on the clock position is completely lost Hikaru gives one check now the King has to move of course and vidit is ready with his move King G8 and Hikaru now chops off the Knight you will see that this Knight on E3 is pinned it's attacked twice it's defended twice so now can with it introduce another attacker there yes he does Queen to G4 5 1 2 3 three pieces in the attack and if you try to defend it with something like Queen D3 there's Knight F4 coming in all sorts of threats Rook a d8 can come in so he plays King E1 Hikaru is ready to give up material but now this is not going to end up good for him because you can notice white is completely undeveloped this game has turned into a complete nightmare for Hikaru Bishop takes E3 played by with it he's recovered his piece and now what do you do the idea is to now take the bishop on C1 the Rooks are coming into the game as well Rook d8 he takes on G4 and with it has many good options he can take with Queen just don't take with the pawn because somehow Queen at even this is fine but why do you want to allow such a check to come in so Bishop G4 with it quietly take takes with the queen queen takes G4 if you take on E3 I'm going to take with the Knight attack your queen and the pawn well Hikaru takes it that's not going to help his cause oh maybe he has an idea he wants to after Knight takes E3 which with's going to play play Queen B3 plays Queen E2 if you go Queen B3 check it can simply block with Rook F7 so that's no problem he goes Queen E2 now you can take here on G2 that's possible that's look that also looks like a good move but Hikaru is just lost here check by with it if Queen F2 there is Queen takes E5 so he goes King D2 attacking the Knight but maybe it's time to introduce your last piece into the attack bring all the pieces into the play bring all your friends to the party Rook d8 comes in now you have a knight queen and the Rook attacking the King has to go back to C1 what is the finishing blow here you don't need to hurry you can be calm you can see that the Rook is controlling the key file key here file and queen comes in there's no way for the king to escape if you go Knight D2 then there is Knight C4 winning the game so he goes B3 and now vidth has many many ways to win but the cleanest is a check and go here with a fork Knight F1 to G3 is game over with it plays his Knight to F1 a check and Knight G3 coming in next what a game look at these pieces of Hikaru Nakamura they are terrible I think there's nothing left for him but to resign the game and I believe that is what is going to happen viit Gujarati has played an absolutely scintilating game 29 moves perfect preparation and then perfect execution of the attack the world number three extends his hand in resignation VI it has won let's hear how and what they have to say after the game as they analyze but tak2 a of three yeah I'm not saying and I'm not saying you're not better but it's not just losing of course I go go sh G5 and6 yeah6 yeah the whole the problem also I was going to go into s game and then I didn't go into itage you I me good stop st that hold this last what's that I mean after5 it's B okay no I just I forgot you be six this you're going I'm sure you're going to go to that when I for I thought I had something there I me give me possible slight B off black can't of yeah I don't know what the whole thing is [Music] going [Music] you"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary

is our vishali saloa is born in 2003 and is just 20 years old Vali on the other hand born in 2001 is 22 years old Wali had a tough game in the previous round she did lose to tan jongi so it'll be interesting to see how she faces saloa here she is in tremendous form and is also backed by Ivan cherino and goeran two grand Masters in her team vishali is here with Sandi Panda let's see what the opening brings us you can see Wali taking her time before the first move and opens with 1 E4 if we had to categorize Vali as a player then it would be attacking attacking style is what she's known for and that to brilliant intuitive sacrificial chess that is her way of playing she brings out her Knight to F3 and I think salimova ooh she goes for the Petro wow maybe it's more about playing the opponent than playing any like the opening as such because salimova knows Vali is an aggressive player why not play the super solid Petro so takes the the pawn on E5 and now I I believe salimova pushes the Knight back yes this is the main line petro and I'm interested to see what Wali has up her sleeve because you know if you go down the main lines of Petro it's such a solid opening it's very difficult to get an advantage here for white we will see Knight takes E4 the main moves here are D4 and Knight C3 Vali goes for Knight to C3 and offers a trade of Knight Knights uh saloa chops it off Knight take C3 and here there are two ways to take but D Tak C3 is the most logical because you are opening up your Bishop in the opening you want to get your pieces out as quickly as possible so salimova goes Bishop E7 and this line was all the rage in early 2010s you know vishi Anand I know played it so many times made it so popular because here white is playing aggressively now for black there are two ways to play one is to try and long castle by getting all these pieces out but saloa just short castles and she tells Vali I am ready for a fight here you know why because wal is going to bring her Queen up which she did right now and she's go to Long castle and then we will have Kings on the opposite flanks and this will lead to amazing fight Knight comes to D7 the Knight will be very well placed on F6 and that is what salimova wants to do here and now Vali long castles so the battle lines have been drawn uh it will be white who will try to attack on the king side black will try to attack on the queen side Knight comes out to F6 this position has been reached 635 times and wali's move Bishop D4 has been only played once before so it's a new idea and I think the logic is D5 is generally played when white goes Bishop D3 but here uh if you play Bishop D4 and now D5 then I can take take and capture the pawn on D5 so saloa goes Bishop D7 and Vali now plays her Pawn up to H4 typical attacking chess here and by the way salimova is down to 1 Hour 1 minute Wali has 1 hour 10 minutes Rook E8 played now this is a dangerous move she should have preferred Knight coming to G4 but now Rook E8 the reason why this move is dangerous is because the Knight can jump to G5 yes it does beautiful move there by Vali the Knight jumps in and is looking at the squares on F7 and H7 and this is a dangerous night saloa says Wali please can you get your knight away from here I don't want it to be here well the point is Vali I'm sure is not going to move it because once you take Pawn takes opens up the Rook she brings Bishop D3 in fact even possible here was Bishop C4 pretty good move there but she goes Bishop C D3 which is fine and of course taking the Knight would not be a good idea so saloa finds a good move Knight G4 now Wali may have to come back with the Knight she could think about some checks but then King f8 is possible what she sacrifices a piece she gives up her Knight is she going to get back the piece King takes saloa instantly takes it is it Queen F4 check no the Knight can go back what is her idea she gives a check it seems Bishop C4 check is what Wali has played and now if you play Bishop E6 I can take take check and win this Knight so that's the reason why saloa goes King f8 and now where's the attack Queen D3 this is Vali For You Queen H7 coming in and wants to Checkmate on G8 or even Queen G6 coming in and she gives a check this is a mistake the best defense was Bishop F6 here and Bishop E6 and black was holding but Bishop G5 now Wali can take it Queen takes and play King B1 but it seems like right now Wali just plays the king here and tell saloa I don't know what is your idea here because now again Bishop F6 is the only defense but if saloa didn't find it in the previous move why would she find it now Knight E5 played here by her but it doesn't really help I think something's completely gone wrong in Salim moa's calculation because now Bishop takes Knight just take it and you can see Wali calculating but Bishop takes E5 what is your plan because if Rook takes I just take here and it's completely winning she plays Bishop F6 now wo well in a way she has just given up well Bishop takes E5 Bishop F6 now is played but but she's just given up a knight Salim MOA has just PL sort of plundered a knight she could have done that without giving up the Knight and Wali is just brutal she could have you know maybe gone Queen H7 as well but Bishop D6 Pawn takes Queen takes check and now if you play this bishop is hanging Rook E7 it's Queen D5 with a mating attack there so here you will have to block Queen E7 played and now this is just simply winning there's nothing much left why takes Queen takes D7 Queen takes Queen is going to happen here you can see saloa knows that the game is almost almost over she takes the queen but notice the number of Pawns she has lost white has seven pawns black has four only and that is a huge difference at this point of time white is three pawns up rook E4 played maybe trying to get one Pawn back because there's a double attack here but Wali plays Bishop D5 and she attacks the rook and the pawn he plays rookie 2 she plays rookie 2 and with rookie 2 she's trying to attack the F2 Pawn well it's important to finish this off cleanly because imagine that you lose a Pawn on F2 then we have opposite colored Bishops and we don't want to get into that situation now King E8 important and Vali can now chop off this Pawn on B7 or yeah she just takes it Bishop Rook takes B7 and now the important thing is that if you take here I have Rook check King here and with these three pieces in the attack it's just game over you know very strong very powerful so that's the reason why she goes Rook d8 attacking the bishop there are many many ways to play here different idea but why shall finds this very classy move Bishop C4 CU if you take here this time it's check King here check King here and Rook F6 with a check your game over so she plays Rook e D2 Vali brings her Rook with a check just have to be careful about this back rank mate King comes to f8 and I think Wali is very calm she brings her King to C1 she is sure not to allow this back rank things to happen Rook comes back to D7 but that means that now one pair of Rooks are going to get traded trading down is not in Black's favor because you are still three pawns down and now the H4 Pawn is hanging so I believe Wali can calmly defend it yes G3 on the board and I think at this point nil saloa can resign with a clean conscience because her position is just completely uh bad I think salimova is just a little bit overwhelmed by the tournament situation the candidates because she just blundered this game she was not herself she couldn't find the defense Wali uh has managed to actually play a great game for while for Salim MOA it's like a question how will she find her bearings in this tournament for Wali this game could well be the start of her kind of ascent in this tour tournament because she will reach 50% score and in this this tournament every win has its worth has its weight in gold now rookie 2 is a normal move to defend this Pawn but just to show you how Wali is a aggressive player she finds an aggressive way to defend the pawn like if you take here check and you lose the bishop so you know even in these little defensive moves you can see the difference in uh how an aggressive player plays and how a position positional player plays A4 played with the idea of A5 and saloa resigns there Vali scores a rocking win there in the pet first this new idea with Bishop D4 and then sacrificing her Knight then playing this very cool queen move up one square to threaten mate Wali is showing why she belongs here in the candidates tournament and it's going to be exciting to follow how she does [Music] he"}, {"instruction": "Generate a commentary providing an analysis into the following chess

last move was castles here and then B6 C3 played by Hikaru so this is standard D3 ruy Lopez and let's get into the groove now What's Happening Here is that Hikaru has just played his Pawn to C3 and fabii castles now here black is white is always looking for the right moment to hit with D4 so hearu first goes Rook E1 and a very standard move that he's defending the E4 pawn and here the main move is Bishop A7 or something of that sort but here Fabiano plays a relatively lesser played Moon Knight E7 and his point is that after D4 he wants to go back and if you take here he wants to go Knight G4 attacking here and defending this so that's the reason why here Knight D2 was played and now Karana plays Knight to G6 so this transfer of the knight from C6 to G6 is definitely something that black is happy about because the Knight is much more useful there Hikaru also transfers his Knight to the G3 Square so it's a very slow positional game that's developing here Karana now has to decide what his next plan is going to be he can wait with Bishop A7 but he goes for direct play with D5 and it's a very um daring move because in a way your E5 Pawn starts to get a little bit soft here so let's say for example after Pawn takes Pawn you will have an attack on E5 from the rook and the Knight you can see that Hikaru a little bit uh confused with karan's decision of playing D5 but actually Fabby has made quite a good decision he takes Pawn takes pawn and now you can take with the queen but also with the Knight so Karana takes with the Knight and the point is if you take Knight E5 there is an intermediate Bishop F2 because after take if you take back with the Rook a check and you lose the Rook so that's the reason why Karana took here with the Knight Bishop B3 played by Hikaru and C6 by Karana just very solidly supporting his Knight in the center of the board now Hikaru pushes his Pawn to D4 and tries to uh strike in the center Fabby takes it and you can take back with the pawn as well but Hikaru prefers to take with the Knight it's a symmetrical position black is active so is white it looks complet completely even but in such positions you have to be careful Hikaru is very very good at such simple positions he likes to grind Knight F6 played here by Karana and he's saying that now I want to take and give you an isolated Pawn if you try to defend it this way my knight is going to jump here so that's the reason why Hikaru plays H3 stopping it but after Bishop takes D4 now it's a very very committal decision by Karana he's given up his Bishop pair but he's given white an isolated Pawn so the Knight can now sit here comfortably but Hikaru is happy about the fact that he now has the bishop pair so this bishop can move this bishop can come on this diagonal so there's pros and cons for both the things now the bishop goes to C2 takes this beautiful long diagonal that is there and it does feel that white has a slight initiative here but Karana says I'm extremely solid my knight cannot be pushed away I've got my Bishop here my knight is sitting on G6 Knight comes to G3 now the F5 square is a very good Square for the Knight so it is looking at that square along with the bishop here and Karana jumps into F4 before that now definitely the bishop is looking at it but the Knight is well protected also you have to consider some sacrifices that can happen on H3 and G4 Hikaru plays his Rook to E4 attacking the the Knight very important moment now the Knight has to move you can even defend it with Queen D6 but Karana prefers to go back with the Knight Knight to D5 and now Hikaru goes A3 and a logical move he's stopping the knight from jumping here Rook E8 played so both the players making very very normal logical moves uh that are there in the position and Bishop D2 played now the bishop is very well positioned here maybe it's looking at these squares um Knight F6 played by Hikaru by Karana and Hikaru needs to move his Rook but if he moves his Rook away then D4 Pawn would hang so therefore he pins the Knight and Karana immediately asks the question that hey move your Bishop away so Hikaru takes Bishop takes F6 Queen takes F6 and uh quite a standard position here he plays Queen to D2 and I was now wondering if Bishop D5 is any good you know it's a decent move putting the bishop there black doesn't seem to have any real issues but karwana goes Queen G5 and he's offering a trade if you take I think black is fine completely so Hikaru prefers to bring his Rook back which is tricky because somewhere you know he is um stopping the trade and also wanting to bring his Rook to the E5 Karana jumps in with the Knight also he's down to 13 minutes he has to make 15 more moves while Hikaru has 35 minutes and here Hikaru comes up with an amazing move H4 the point is if you take here he wants to go Rook E4 G5 Rook E1 and then control completely the F5 H5 squares it's amazing this move H4 Queen D5 played here by uh Karana and now he moves his Rook to attack the Knight there's an interesting move Knight takes G2 because if you take here F5 will win material so you have to find a move like Queen C3 which traps the Knight here so very complex position but after this Karana moved his Knight backwards Hikaru quickly brought in his rook and now with the growing time trouble which is 12 minutes for 12 moves and also the fact that hikaru's pieces look more active I think Karana is in some trouble he goes Knight f8 you will see that this Knight which was beautifully placed on F4 in two moves has gone back to f8 Rook E5 attacks the Queen the queen has to move away but where exactly should the queen go is the question and uh maybe Karana can go back to D7 but he goes d8 so you can see how one by one all of Black's pieces are being sent back and Hikaru is nodding his head he's enjoying himself he's clammed down the structure with H5 the bishop is beautifully positioned the Queen can come up and now Bishop D7 played the bishop goes back The Rook can be traded once I think Hikaru will do that Rook takes Rook Bishop takes rook and now Knight to F5 what a beautiful Knight which can never be kicked away looks at this key squares here Karana moves his Queen to F6 and Hikaru plays Queen B 4 very cool move attacking B7 but there's another big threat that is there in the position which is a check here King moves and then the f8 Knight would be hanging so he plays B5 which is a massive blunder you can see there Hikaru looking at he knows he's seen the kill here he goes Knight F Knight E7 check and you know you can also see from Kara's face that he knows that the writing is on the wall King h h8 and now the key move Knight D5 attacking the queen and the Knight here and imagine if you take this Knight this is a Checkmate Karana resigns here and Hikaru scores an extremely important win which takes him to 4 and half points now out of eight Karana who was on four remains there Hikaru has jumped him and he's now just half a point behind the leaders what a phenomenal comeback by Hikaru after losing the second round to vidit he's not in full flow and it's not going to be easy to stop him to his journey towards the world
